Our last day in Bangkok, I woke up early to go to the Thai Royal Palace before heading to the airport, as my flight was leaving a few hours later than Laura’s. I caught a cab, who I think over-charged me, but it is still so cheap I didn’t bother protesting.

The Royal Palace is quite large, though compared to other Royal Palaces I’ve seen (France, China) it is almost modest-sized. What certainly isn’t modest though is the ornate decorations and elaborate traditional Thai architecture.

This is obviously a major tourist destination as shortly after opening it was quite crowded. It appears to attract a lot of Chinese tourists (taking pictures everywhere) as well. I wandered around the palace, and saw the famous and prized possession of Thailand, the Emerald Buddha (which in contrast to many of the Buddha statues we’ve seen on this trip, is quite small). Without too much historical context, I took in the sights and then made my way out of the palace.

I thought I would try my luck again at street food, as I saw a number of vendors lining a street near by, but these were mostly all touristy type vendors not selling food. And the ones that were selling food didn’t look like something I wanted to eat (either because there were flies on it, or it just didn’t look appealing). The most unusual vendors I saw on this street, that I haven’t seen anywhere yet were several booths selling false teeth!

Without any good meal options I decided to catch a cab back to my hotel. I’m not sure if my hotel is new, or if it’s just not a heavily visited area by the taxi drivers, but they all seemed to have a hard time finding the hotel, and my last taxi back to the airport drove around in a circle trying to find where a high way on-ramp was! It was surprising to see that the taxi drivers will pick you up and nod when they see the address, and then see if you can call the hotel for directions when they can’t find it.

I got lunch at the hotel, not wanting to push my luck with finding some place else, and not having time to get back to grab my luggage before I needed to be at the airport. It was chicken satay, and had a tasty peanut sauce. It was pretty good and I sipped on a beer as I discovered there was free wi-fi in this area of the hotel!

I then took my roundabout trip to the airport, and arrived with plenty of time which I used to read, work on my photos, and catch up writing blog posts. With about 15 hours of flight time, and closer to 20 when you include shuttles and layovers I still have quite the journey before my trip comes to a close. All of this flying over the international date-line, makes time a strange, relative, and confusing thing. From ancient city to modern-day, and from today flying in to yesterday (technically) I certainly feel a bit like a world and TIME traveler!
