Hallo from München!

This will be a short post, we woke up, we packed, we got lunch, we went to the airport, we waited, we flew, we got train tickets, we waited an hour for a delayed train and then finally went a different route to get to our hotel in Munich, we had to switch trains two more times (total ground travel time after landing ~4 hours, should have been 1), grabbed a snack lunch, walk down a few blocks using “Dyl-intution” or “Dyl-instincts” and then met up with Prentice and Brian at the hotel in Munich! Phew!

Pretty exhausting, patience-trying, day especially having to figure out the train system here. The signs are a little less frequently double labeled in English, so there is some guess work involved. And we believe there was some mechanical problem or something wrong with one of the tracks but they were only making announcements in German, so that was frustrating. I was a little nervous things were running behind schedule, and not as efficient as I was expecting… in my head I’m like, but \*this\* is what I thought was great about Germany!? After we got going though, and stopped for food (a pretzel and hot dog) at one of the places the train we were on stopped, we started having some random encounters with different people. And quickly found that the great thing about Germany (so far at least) are it’s people. Everyone is SO friendly! So many examples: people randomly giving us pointers on directions or instructions, this old lady insisted that we take her seat, and then had this big smile on her face and later made sure we knew how to open the doors to the train and wished us a good rest of our days in Munich, these random guys in lederhosen’s came up and started chatting with us and were saying they were from California too (though considering their accents we all doubted it). So from having a very negative first impression, the fact that we took a train instead of a taxi to the hotel actually turned that initial negative impression of Germany into one of a great place with friendly people! Granted, many of them may be drunk as it is Oktoberfest, but still incredibly friendly.
