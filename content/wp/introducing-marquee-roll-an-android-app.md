It was actually a lot of fun, and I think I was able to walk away (not really, Iâ€™m still gonna work on it) with a pretty nifty app!

I encourage you to check it out if you have an Android device, and give me some feedback on what you think, what you like, what you think I could add! Happy movie searching!
