After a nice full-nights sleep, on a comfortable mattress, it was time to rise and shine and go to Macau! Macau is another special administrative region of China, similar to Hong Kong only instead of formally being ruled by the British, Macau was ruled by Portugal. Today what Macau is famous for is its casino’s. It is a sort of mini-Las Vegas.

Before heading out, we swung by the shopping-center connected to the hotel complex and found a super market where we bought food for brunch. We then got on the MTR (subway) to ride to Hong Kong Island where we’d catch a Ferry over to Macau. All this went off without a glitch. When we got there the next available shuttle was leaving at 3:30 PM, which would be cutting it very close to a 5PM curtain time for a show we had tickets for. Without any better choices, we bought the tickets and used our extra time to explore the mall the Ferry terminal was connected to. It’s funny how Western all the malls are, while they of course have some unique shops, and everything is slightly different. It’s only slightly, they still have food brands, luxury brand stores, etc.

We caught the ferry over, and then a free shuttle bus, and arrived at the hotel where our show was at with few minutes to spare. We literally ran through the hotel following the signs leading to our show only to end up finding out we were just a little too late, and would have to wait in the lobby through the first number before being let in to the theatre.

The show was House of Dancing Water at the City of Dreams Hotel/Casino, and was really incredible! The show was immensely technical, which I enjoyed, and was on a three-quarters round stage. The inner circle portion of the stage was made of several segments that would raise and lower, as well as having many fountains connected to it that would shoot up water! What really made it unique though was when the stage would lower far enough, it would become submerged in water turning the show into a part aquatic show. The show was full of spectacle, incredibly talented performers, and technical marvels (think a Cirque du Soleil style). Sure it didn’t have a lot of plot (loosely about a romance between a western man and an eastern girl), and might have been a little disconnected at times, but was incredible and absolutely worth it!

After that show we wandered through the casino portion of the hotel (where no photography was allowed, though it didn’t look like anything special, so I don’t know why). And eventually came upon the ‘Bubble Show’, which was a 360 degree projection show. It also didn’t really have a plot that I could explain (something about dragon statues coming alive), but was a pretty cool experience and well-done in my opinion.

Both performances surprisingly allowed pictures, which was pretty unique I thought.

Following the Bubble Show, we crossed the street to Macau’s Venetian, an almost identical copy of the one in Las Vegas! Only here during the time we were there (lucky us) it was ‘Carnevale’ and there were these opera singers performing outside, and in the balcony!

We ended up finding a restaurant called Caton inside, and though it wasn’t very crowded (we figured most people here, weren’t going to the Venetian to eat Chinese food) the food was quite tasty! One of those many small dishes kinds of place that have a focus on quality over quantity, and kind of pricey for what we got. It was all very good though and was claiming to have won all these awards.

After dinner we had to rush back to the Ferry station, and after literally running around trying to find a shuttle ended up taking a taxi, not wanting to chance missing our Ferry out of Macau! It was a long series of public transportation connections to get back to our hotel from Macau, but we did make it back, quite tired but also pleased with our day. Though we didn’t get the chance to explore too much of Macau, it was nice to have a little bit of a lighter day as Laura and I both agreed we seem to be running on a greater sleep deficit than previous trips.
