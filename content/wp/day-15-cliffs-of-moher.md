My second to the last full day in Ireland had an early start as we had to be at another bus tour pick up site by 8AM. So a little sleepy we made out way to the pick up site or our journey to the Cliffs of Moher.

For this tour I made sure to get an aisle seat where I could try and lean out to see the white line on the road to prevent be from being bus sick again. It helped a bit, and I’m glad I did, because this guide/driver was much worse than the driver on the other bus. He was also the guide and really was rather obnoxious which spoiled quite a bit of the experience. He was pretty adamant us not talking when he did so that everyone could hear him since he talks fast (which he did talk really fast, too which I could say maybe he should slow down a bit since this is his job, and he repeated himself a lot so he could say half the words in twice the time and we wouldn’t have missed anything) but what was really rather obnoxious was he would periodically pause and get upset and scold us for talking while he was claiming if he could hear us talking so could the entire bus. But every-time he did this… I couldn’t hear anyone. Maybe he forgets that he’s talking in to a microphone that has speakers throughout the entire bus. But in any case between his poor driving, and belittling attitude I’d stay away from Paddywagon tours just in case I got him again.

We made a stop at some castle, and a monastery, and a few random other spots but honestly I think they were all just pit stops on the way to Irelands west coast to see the main attraction- the Cliffs of Moher.

Eventually we stopped in a small town for lunch, where because it was the end of tourist season there was apparently only one place open still. While it was really busy with the remaining tourist bus companies all dropping off their passengers here they were surprisingly quick and not a bad meal either.

Finally we were on our way to see the Cliffs of Moher and thankfully we had pretty good weather and they were incredible! As tall as the empire state building, the pictures don’t really do them justice. It was very windy here but we walked around for probably an hour soaking in the impressive sights.

After the cliffs we had one more random pit stop, the term ABC (As he called it, Another Bloody Castle… I’ve also heard AFC) comes to mind. Before about a 3 hour drive back to the east side of Ireland

For dinner we stopped at the Storehouse that we did the first day, and had another enjoyable dinner. Afterwards we stopped for ice cream and they had this delicious caramel honeycomb ice-cream that I treated myself for as dessert.
