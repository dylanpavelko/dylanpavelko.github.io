Let’s Hangout! Okay, so I’m in San Francisco for the summer, so most of you probably won’t be able to use this any time soon. But I wanted to code up this little tool to help make it easier to hang out when I’m back in SLO (or if your going to make a trip to visit me :P).

I’ve found it increasingly challenging to overlap schedules and find times when both parties are free in order to schedule a meeting, hang out, etc. And since I use multiple Google Calendars (rant: Google should make sub calendars where you can change the color of each calendar) it’s hard for me to share all of my calendars with people via google to check my schedule. So now if you want to know when I’m available (or what I’m busy with) you can check my posted calendar (that has all of my calendars) on my website [here](http://www.dylanpavelko.com/c_cal.html). Creating this was easy, google pretty much does all the work for you.

(It get’s sent to a PENDING calendar, and then emails me to check it and then I can confirm it by placing it on one of my other main calendars). It’s pretty nifty and has had several trial runs, and 1 real test so far!

It all happens instantly too so if you hit refresh on my calendar, during the time you set up it will say (busy) in orange. (Unless you schedule a multi-day event… then it won’t show up immediately. Trying to find a work-around)

So check your schedule, check my schedule, and lets hang out! (Let me know if you encounter any bugs in it, or have suggestions).
