The following is my submitted (yet, unpublished) response to a cover page article run in Cal Poly’s Mustang Daily during Engineers Week. Read the full article here: [Ms. Engineer Contest No More](http://mustangdaily.net/ms-engineer-no-more/).

<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif;">Dear Editor,</span>

<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif;">For the first time in years, I saw a cover page story on Engineers Week (eWeek). How unfortunate that it wasn’t a story about how students can become engaged in the week’s activities. But instead Mustang Daily chose to report about how an event, historically one of the week’s lowest attended (the Ms. Engineers Contest), was being replaced with another event hosted by the same club (Society of Women Engineers.) Meanwhile, depicting the dedicated group of student volunteers in the Engineering Student Council (ESC) as proponents of the status quo.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif;">ESC spends a year planning to make each year’s eWeek bigger, and better than the year before. Events are known for having large quantities of free food and impressive prizes, all at no cost to students! (Previously, with the exception of the Ms. Engineer Contest, that SWE advertised cost to compete in.)</span>

<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif;">Cal Poly’s SWE does many impressive events that have rightfully gained their respect both on campus and nationally. But the Ms. Engineer Contest never held a candle to the successes of SWE’s other events. Last year’s event had only four contestants, one of which in her speech said she was doing it because she was “volun-told.”</span>

<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif;">Hopefully next year’s cover page eWeek article can be about how students can participate in the many engaging events, like SWE’s Talent Show they had this year, instead of trying to invent a scandal.</span>
