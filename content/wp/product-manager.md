<header class="major">Working on the future of software for higher education.
-------------------------------------------------------

</header>Dylan Pavelko’s passion for higher education is rooted in leadership roles he took in student government while pursuing his electrical engineering undergraduate degree at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. After graduating in 2011 his continued enthusiasm for maximizing students’ potential for success as well as their experience at school motivates his designs to stay student-centric. It’s also easy to think like a “millennial” when you are one. Dylan has worked professionally at web-based companies since graduating and has been designing his own websites since he could get his hands on his first dial-up connection.

Dylan looks forward to using his technology background and enthusiasm for student success to ensure that while earning a degree can be challenging and require a lot of hard work, figuring out how to get a degree shouldn’t!
