This morning we packed up our bags and headed out to catch our euro start train to London. We fairly successfully navigated the transit system again, however as our luck wither larger rail systems in Paris would have it, we ended up being a couple minutes late to our train! Fortunately they were able to put us on the next train, which was only 1 hour later.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

It was crazy to think that while we woke up in Paris, we would soon be in London. Is this real life? Eventually we arrived in London at St. Pancras station. This happens to be right next to Kings Cross Station, so we couldn’t help ourselves to wander over and see if we couldn’t stumble across platform 9 3/4. Unfortunately it looks like you needed a ticket to actually get to any of the platforms. Oh well! Now for us to figure out how to get around this city with only our ‘muggle’ transportation means. We went down to the underground and without too much difficulty this time, got to our hotel! I did in the process some how lose my stack of papers with our itinerary on it! I didn’t think we had anything to mission critical in it, but it was still a small set back.

When we got to our hotel room we discovered it was fairly nice, though pretty small. The strangest part of this room was the bathroom. The toilet, shower, and sync were all just in the same room …. With just a curtain separating them. When I say in the same room, I mean there is no bath tub or separating floor between the “dry” side from the “wet” side.

Once dropping off our stuff, we rushed over to Westminster Abbey, where we just barely made it in time to catch the last verger led tour of the abbey. This was certainly well worth the difference. We were granted special access to normally private areas of the abbey. The abbey is quite impressive, and it was also enjoyable to have everything in English. As compared to many of the historic sites in Paris, the Abbey seemed to be much older. Perhaps this is because many of the original historic sites in Paris were destroyed during the French revolution, or maybe the English tend to not give as many details about things that have been restored versus being original.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

In any case we were able to see the coronoation chair that has been used to crown the kings and queens of England for many centuries, the resting place of such kings and queens such as Queen Elizabeth, the alter floor that the cornations take place, and Prince William and Kates wedding took place, as well as the chapel behind the alter that the royal family disappeared to during the ceremony to sign the marriage documents away from the camera’s. (This is the resting place of several Kings and Queens).

After our tour ended we were able to explore the garden area of the abbey which apparently is the oldest cultivated garden in England.

One of the remarkable things about this area was at one point just walking down the street you could see Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, and the London Eye all lined and in view of each other. This was quite convenient for us, as we planned on seeing all 3 today.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

After the abbey we walked by Big Ben and crossed Westminster Bridge. Big Ben (which is actually the name of the bell in the clock tower that tolls, not the tower itself) is incredibly impressive and ornate. It is also quite symbolic of my first impression with the people of London is that compared to Parisians time is of the essence, and thinks are done much more precisely by a schedule. This is so clearly symbolized with Big Ben being featured in the center of the town.

After crossing the bridge we got our tickets for the London Eye and the ‘4D experience’. The 4D experience was a movie that was suppose to excite you about your trip on the Eye. And while it wasn’t the best 3D filming I had ever seen, the video was quite clever on how they made it 4D. I’d argue that rather then being 4D it was 4 senses, as it incorporated the room you were in with smells, touch, sights, and sounds. It was quite clever really, even if a bit cheesey.

We then hopped on the London Eye which slowly revolves around like a ferris wheel, that takes 30 minutes to complete your 1 rotation. It was quite scenic and differently gave some great 360 degree views of London that wouldn’t be easy to see anywhere else.

Following the London Eye, we went on a Thames Boat Tour, where we got to float down the Thames river and see some of the famous sites we’ve grown up learning about. St. Pauls Cathedral, the Globe Theatre, London Bridge, etc. The tour guide on the boat tour interlaced quite a bit of British wit in with his schpeal to make it quite enjoyable. Much of London is reconrustctions of previous monuments that burned in the great London Fire, where some very high percentage of all the buildings in London burned. The London Bridge that we see today is fairly recent, but a bridge crossing in the same spot it does today has apparently been recorded to date back 2000 years to the days of Romans ruling the land.

As you can see by the pictures (once I post them), it was pretty cloudy and much colder than we were use too being in Paris. So the boat ride was fairly cold, but still enjoyable and well worth it. To go find some dinner we then had a bit of a mishap on a bus situation and ended up going in the wrong direction. Luckily a nice gentlemen overheard our conversation … since you know… they all speak English here! And gave us his suggestion to get us back where we wanted to be.

We ended up getting back to our general hotel area, which ended up being pretty close to the West End (where all the theatres are), and we decided to grab dinner at some random pub we went in to. Prices didn’t seem too bad, but converting pounds to dollars makes everything a lot pricier then we expect. Having a weak dollar certainly hurts us abroad! The food was pretty good, dramatically different though then what we had become accustomed to in Paris. We both ordered some variety of fish &amp; chips and a cider. Quite British, yes?

Laura then happened to notice some emails had for some reason downloaded to her phone, so after taking a glance we saw one that said someone had turned in our itinerary paperwork at the London Underground station I had lost it at, which happened to be right next to where we were eating! Luck had returned to our side, and we were able to go pick it up. (Of course everthing must be balanced in the world, so it started to rain, and I had to buy an umbrella…. But that’s fine, one more souvenir, and happy to have all of my notes. Especially since there is no free wifi here at this hotel.)

I am not sure if we didn’t notice, or again just different cultures, but we became aware of world news again here in London. People reading newspapers, and news channels on TVs (and yes, again, it helps that they spoke in English). But it made both of us rather aware that we really had no idea what was going on in the U.S. right now. Going from Paris to London I think has better illustrated the cultural contrasts for me. As in general London feels, of course special and much more majestic then any city I’ve been too, kind of similar to what I imagine going to a new city I have never been too in the states would be like—New York, for instance. Not drawing a comparison between the two, just that there are probably more similarities between the experience I would have as a first time tourist finding my way around and dealing with the locals.

Of course, they do drive on the other side of the road here, and as a pedestrian you have to constantly be alert that you aren’t stepping in front of what you thought was a clear road.

London has been fun and interesting so far! Looking forward to our hodge-podge of exciting activities we have tomorrow!
