Well, as my dear friends are already quickly reminding me, it appears I have completed another orbit around our sun. What has literally been the longest year of my life (it was a leap year that also had a [leap second](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second)!) turned out to be a great year indeed- a year of beginings and endings.

I finished my last college classes and graduated college.  
I started my first professional career position.  
I said good bye (for now) to many friends, and moved away from my hometown for the first time.  
And am now getting to say â€˜Helloâ€™ and meeting many new friends.

To balance out all the optimism of this blog, one might suggest that things could only get worse from here. (Of course, Iâ€™m not that pessimistic. ðŸ™‚ )

Best wishes to all of you! Thanks for sharing your time with me.
