After going to school for nearly two decades (yes, I’m counting pre-school) I have finally reached the mountain top! Seeing all the different area’s of my online ‘Degree Progress’ evaluation change to green ‘complete’ bubbles is a rather indescribable feeling! I feel excited, relieved, accomplished, nervous, terrified …. but mostly excited and happy!

Just like most the mountain’s I’ve ever climbed though, when you finally do get to the top, it appears there is yet another mountain in front of you that is a little bit taller than you. For now that mountain is establishing myself as a professional. And I am happy to say that I can think of no better place to do this at, than the company I have just signed an offer of employment with, [Workday](http://www.workday.com/)!

Workday is a fairly new (created in 2005) Software as a Service (SaaS) company that creates enterprise business management software in the [cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). Very forward thinking, awesome company culture (including the employees I’ve met), and all around a great place to both grow and contribute as a professional. I’ll be working as an Associate Test Engineer, and using many of the skills that I learned at my prior job during my last quarter at Cal Poly.

What perhaps will be the biggest change for me, is that I will leaving for the first time (other than 1 summer internship), the city of my birth, beautiful San Luis Obispo! (Workday is located in Pleasanton, CA) Now I can already hear the chorus telling me how it’s good to experience new things, and new places. But I imagine it is going to be harder than I’d like. I chose to stay in SLO, partly because of the amazing engineering program that Cal Poly has, but also because it’s a wonderful little city. There are so many people, and places that I love here it will be challenging to leave. I know I will make new friends (and I already do have some great friends in the area) and that it will probably be good for me to get out of SLO for a while. But like a lot of things that are good for you, not always the easiest route. That said SLO is, and will always be my home-base. (I already miss it, and I haven’t even left!?) So to all you SLO people, you can count on me to visit! =)

As I go through this huge period of change in my life, I hope to find time to update this blog a little bit more regularly than I have been able to recently. Partly to keep anyone who is interested informed in what is the latest and greatest in the life of Dylan. But also just as a place to pause and reflect.

I still have about a month before I start, which will get partly filled up with the task of moving. But I also plan on enjoying my last few weeks in SLO: I’m helping out with one last show at the SLO Little Theatre, which will be a delight, and eating at my favorite places, with my favorite people!

In summary, I feel excited, relieved, accomplished, nervous, terrified …. but mostly excited and happy!
