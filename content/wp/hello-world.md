Hello, World!! Well, I finally made the move to the real world wide web with my own domain name!  
I am pretty excited! =)

One extra perk of no longer living solely on the [Cal Poly](http://calpoly.edu) server is that I can now have a word press account AKA a BLOG! So we will see what happens with this. Hopefully because of the acclaimed ease of word press I will post more often than I have on past blog attempts. ðŸ˜‰

Also a big **THANK YOU** to [Prentice](http://prenticew.com) who helped me get going with this new site!!!

Bests,

-Dylan
