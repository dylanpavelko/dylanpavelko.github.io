I thought I would write this up as a blog, since I have been brainstorming with several of you about how to solve this problem.

Problem Summary: For my senior project, one thing I would like to be able to do is locate the exact location of an object in three dimensional space, using known distances from the object to either three or four known points.

After much brain-wracking, and even more crumpled up sheets of engineering paper (donâ€™t worryâ€¦ i got it for free, thanks chevron recruiting booth at the job fair!) I can up with a general solution. It does have a couple stipulations for it to work, but it does in deed work! So I thought Iâ€™d post it so those I talked about it with could enjoy the solution, as well as others!

Itâ€™s extreme-algebra 2 math, that makes use of the equation of spheres. As I post more about my senior project idea the use for this will become more and more relevant Iâ€™m sure! ðŸ˜‰

Here is the solution:

Have fun checking out my math!
