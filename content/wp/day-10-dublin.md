The first thing I did on my first full day in Dublin was sleep-in! Ahh, having a week in a location is wonderful and allows you to take the area in a slower pace. And thus, sleep more! I also plan on working a day here or there in the office so I anticipate these blog posts being a bit more brief then the rest of the trips were. My fellow travelers are also working during the work week, so I am mostly on my own for some of these mini-trips.

After eating breakfast I made my way through St. Stephens Green, a very nice green square near where we were staying. Not near the size of a central park, or golden gate park, but a nice green area with lots of flowers and open space. Quite pleasant to walk through on this sunny morning.

I then made my way to Grafton street where I did a little bit of shopping, and grabbed some lunch at a grocery store that was in the basement of the store I was doing my clothe shopping at.

As I left the building though sure enough, the sun had disappeared and it was raining. This is the Ireland I was expecting! The once busy streets had disappeared, and so I had to hop in to another shop and buy an umbrella. (I had actually packed one on the trip, but it went missing after I checked my bag at a museum in Florence!)

I cut through St. Stephenâ€™s Green again with my purchases, and almost enjoyed the green more in the rain then I did in the sun!

After dropping off my stuff back at the apartment, I realized there that one of the places I was planning on going to was closed Mondays. So I did a little schedule shuffle and embarked towards Trinity College.

It worked out well, because along my path there I walk by a group of bag pipers in a circle. I have no idea what building they were outside of, or why they were all dressed up playing, but part of my mind would like to believe thatâ€™s just the way it is here in Ireland. ðŸ˜‰

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">At Trinity College it struck me that it was actually a college. Duh! So there were tons of college students around. I was more intersted in checking out the old library though, specifically the long room. To do so, you also have to pay to see the Book of Kells.</span>

The Book of Kells was pretty neat, and impressive how intricately the writing and artwork was done. Probably a little overpriced for what it was, but I had been warned that it was rather underwhelming (similar to warnings Iâ€™d received about the size of the Mona Lisa) and as a result was probably more impressed with both.

Afterwards I went upstairs to the long room, which was this long old, dark library that looked straight out of a movie set. (Actually I had been told it was the inspiration for a few actual movie sets).

It was cool, and had some more ancient books on display, as well as some massive banners that told some of the history of Ireland. I was rushing against the clock in terms of the placeâ€™s closing time. So I just snapped pictures of the banners and will read them later.

Overall a pretty neat place to see, but yea, a bit pricey.

I then headed back and ended up making some dinner with Prentice. Afterwards the group all got together again to celebrate Athenaâ€™s birthday at a tea place (that Iâ€™m assuming she picked out) that was a very casual, hang out type of coffee shop sort of place.

Tomorrow I am going in to work to attack my inbox that Iâ€™ve done my best to leave unchecked while Iâ€™ve been on PTO. And unless anything incredibly eventful happens will probably hold off on posting anything until the subsequent day where I will be resuming my role as a tourist.
