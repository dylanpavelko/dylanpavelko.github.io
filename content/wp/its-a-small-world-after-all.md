After travelling by plane (5 different airlines), by boat (ferry, and long boat), by car (taxi, shuttles, private drivers), by gondala, and by elephant I have made it home again. Looking back on the past two weeks, it certainly was quite the whirl-wind of adventure going through four unique and fantastic countries.

Sad that my exploring new cities, and vacationing has come to a close, but also quite happy to be sleeping in my own bed again. I am certainly home, and full of great memories.
