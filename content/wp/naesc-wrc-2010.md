Last weekend I went down (along with 16 fellow Cal Poly ESC members) to the NAESC Western Regional Conference hosted by UC San Diego! The conference was attended by aprox. 11 different engineering councils from across the state (plus 2 from AZ, 1 from HI, and 1 from CO)! It was pretty neat to see because this was my 6th NAESC conference that I have attended, and in comparison to 3 years ago- only three schools were a part of the region. (I like to think that Cal Poly hosting nationals recently!)

This year I gave a presentation on Cal Poly’s Engineers Week (eWeek) and how we grew our eWeek celebrations to a much larger event on campus! I also talked about our passport system, recently called “eScan”, where we use barcodes on post-card sized schedules of the weeks activities that we use to track attendance and give away prizes for. The amazing developers of this program plan to have version 2 completed with plenty of time to share with other ESC’s that they can use in their eWeeks! (More information will be posted here about the download process, once it is complete.)

It was a pretty fun weekend, with some special celebrity alumni’s making guest appearances \*cough\* Joel \*cough\* Jessica \*cough\* Prentice \*cough\* …sorry I have a cold! =)

Here is my presentation [Engineers\_Week](http://www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Engineers_Week.pdf) for your viewing pleasure.
