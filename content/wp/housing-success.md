My [last post](http://www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/?p=75) was complaining about how I still hadn‚Äôt found a place to live in the city during my internship this summer. Well I am very happy to say that **I signed the lease for a studio apartment TODAY (6/19)!!**

I went ahead and took a couple pictures of the place +view so you can see where I will be living for next 3 months! (You can see exactly where I am with this [Google Map link](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=&sll=37.779331,-122.414893&sspn=0.005486,0.01045&gl=us&g=1165+Market+St,+San+Francisco,+California+94103&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=&ll=37.779348,-122.414893&spn=0.002323,0.01045&t=h&z=17&iwloc=A&layer=c&cbll=37.779081,-122.414301&panoid=6IDVnIpx9JWYhfEqI88dHg&cbp=11,135.21,,0,-3.47) too)

Here is a picture coming in from the door of the same area plus now the bedroom üôÇ[![](https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_82971.png?resize=403%2C186 "IMG_82971")](https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_82971.png)A clearer view outside of my window during daylight! (Yes that is Wicked playing at the Orpheum Theatre across the street)

And a set of images that I didn‚Äôt taken (but were on the places website) showing off their amenities.

The place is called Trinity Plaza, and was pretty fair (actually pretty NICELY) priced. Yesterday my grandpa and I went around to look at different places I had appointments for. The first one I looked at cost more, and simply put was scary. I guess, it would have been tolerable if I had to live there, but everything just looked dirty: the manager, the halls, the elevator (the one that worked), oh‚Ä¶ and the studio (broken appliances, bugs on the fridge). It was hard to look at because at the time I was facing with a very realistic possibility of having to live in the place. (On the plus side if I ever wanted to buy crack‚Ä¶ I bet I know where I can find some üòõ )

So after being told to give ourselves our own tour, we looked around and were pretty quickly off to see our second place and very hopeful that this one would be nicer (but nervous because it wasn‚Äôt as expensive) . Luckily, it was! Contrasted by the manager who came out from some back room after several ‚ÄúHello?!‚Äùs in a dirty tank top, this complex had several individuals working on leases, all professionally dressed in a glass room office. The building was clean (the outside perimeter is a little dirty) But talk about night and day! It has a pool, a fitness room, laundry rooms on every floor, and the studio was way nicer (not to mention I didn‚Äôt feel like I would contract a STD if I touched the walls!) Oh did I mention the utilities (all but internet) are PAID! \*cha-ching!\*

Additionally the place comes furnished with a bed (which is new), table, dresser, love-seat, lamp, and night-stand! The management specifically the person I dealt with (Ian) was excellent! My place faces Market St., which is one of the main roads downtown (where I am) so I expect things to be a little bit noisy (at all hours). But hopefully I am a heavy enough sleeper, that it won‚Äôt be an issue. However, my Market St view is of the [Orpheum Theatre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheum_Theatre_(San_Francisco,_California)), which is currently playing [WICKED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical))! I have got to get some tickets for that before I -or it- leave (whichever happens first).

Needless to say, I am quite pleased and thankful!!! üôÇ

The couple of experiences I have had in the city have been pretty eye opening so far, sure is a lot different then little ol‚Äô [SLO town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo,_California)! Other then the gigantic buildings and crazy traffic, one of the first things I became aware of was the amount of homelessness. There are people all over that just look like they‚Äôve been down on their luck for too long. I arrived for my lease signing appointment this morning a little early (and ended up just walking around to see what was near). I saw all sorts of people with a dirty blanket thrown on top of them, laying in any nook they could find in front of shops that hadn‚Äôt yet opened for the day. The homeless varied from people who would just sit and stare, to walk around and shout at no-one in particular. Several of them walk with a cane (I get the feeling more for protection then for any physical disability). Almost all of them are minorities, although minorities are by far the majority here (whenever I overhear English conversations on the street I am genuinely surprised!) The city just has that feel of caution, it seems like the objective is to not make eye contact with anyone when walking about.

I don‚Äôt have my plans figured out yet, but I have plans to make lots of plans, to go check out all sorts of things in the city. I figure I‚Äôll be here for 3 months why not go explore as much as possible. See things I can‚Äôt see in SLO. (And bring my camera to share the experience!)

So that is my happy-ending housing story (for now, I‚Äôll keep you posted if chapter 2 has any surprises/complaints). I‚Äôll also try and squeeze in a blog post about how my first week of work is going in-between working and taking my online quizzes for my summer classes! I start Monday at 8:30AM!! üôÇ
