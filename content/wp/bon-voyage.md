As some of you know, and now any of you reading this, I am about to embark on my first international journey!

On a vacation I am naming ‘A Trip to Two Cities’ (playing on a [famous book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities) title about my two destinations) I will be discovering Paris, France and London, England! I’ve have a fairly loaded itinerary, full of as many things as I could squeeze in my trip. To help me fully appreciate this journey I plan on documenting it via this blog- converting it to a ‘travel-blog’ for the length of my journey.

No promises on how fast I’ll be able to turn around pictures and write up little blurbs, but I’ll do my best!
