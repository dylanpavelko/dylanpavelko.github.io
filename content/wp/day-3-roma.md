After a slightly later start than we were anticipating we grabbed some pizza from a shop, and hopped on the metro to go to the colosseum! Again we purchased tickets in advance for this, which made it much easier to cut the line and get right in. The colosseum was pretty impressive both in size, and the fact that it is still standing after so many years!

It was incredible to look at and try and imagine what it would have looked like with it’s marble seats, and a full stadium floor. It was also rather strange to think about the type of entertainment that occurred in this very stadium. Gladiators fights, to other cruel battles the Romans seemed to enjoy their violence (as one thing I read said, almost as much as the Americans… which when you think about the types of movies our society watches, it’s an interesting perspective).

Right next door to the colosseum is the Roman Forum, which our tickets got us entry into as well. We walked over and explored the ruins of what was once the center of Roman life. First we explored what appeared to be a large estate or palace connected to the forum, before walking through the Forum square. Again it was incredible to look at these artifacts and 1- appreciate just how old they are and 2- imagine what they would have looked like in their prime. Reading my Rick Steve’s book along the way helped paint the picture, as well as provide some interesting perspectives on notions of how high the ground level once was before this entire area was excavated. From what is now pretty gardens, to large (very tall rooms), to temples it was pretty neat to look at and appreciate the history of these ruins.

We then walked around, tried to find a restaurant that ended up being closed, made our way to the Piazza Navona, \*picture\* \*picture\*, then the pantheon, more pictures, and then finally we went and found a place for dinner, Life Ristorante. It was good, more upscale than we have eaten at so far. We were very happy to rest our legs and eat a delicious meal. Though their portion sizes could have been bigger, it was still a great dinner.

Afterwards we wandered up towards the Spanish Steps, which isn’t necessarily ‘extra scenic’ as much as it is just a big congregation area with very wide steps people sit on. We hung out here for a bit and snapped our first full group shot, before heading back to the metro station and home. And by home I mean the gelato shop (Lemon Grass) near our apartment! You didn’t think we could go a full day without gelato did you? Then we went real home to rest up before an early start the following day.

As we were walking home Jessica asked me what my first impressions of Rome were, since today really was the first day we went more than a few blocks from our apartment in Rome. And to be honest I couldn’t really come up with a good answer. It’s nice, the food is probably my favorite part. It’s also very touristy though, and in some ways almost repetitive. I am definitely having a great time, but also can see how some people say you don’t need more than 3 days to see Rome. That said, it’s something you should definitely take the opportunity to see if you ever get the chance, and probably would make for a good pit-stop destination on future trips.
