Realized I haven’t really done a personal update blog, like I promised I would, since I have moved. It took making a trip down to SLO for me to realize this! (I must be keeping busy) In any case, here goes:

I just got back from a trip to SLO, for Cal Poly’s graduation (Congratulations Graduates…. go forth, and prosper!) I had a great time, and got to visit with my family and many of my friends, that I have made over the past decade of my life. Though exhausting, (hello fellow introverts!) I really enjoyed catching up with everyone. But what surprised me most, was what I thought about on my drive back up to northern California.

The first 22 years of my life I spent in San Luis Obispo, and while it is a really special place (I still plan on visiting often), and I can think of none better to grow up in– I thought I was going to have a closer attachment with the city itself when I returned. Yes, I ate at all my favorite place, thoroughly enjoyed all the views, and yes, I haven’t actually been gone all that long. But the strong affection I feel for my hometown I realized was more about the people I have met, and the relationships I formed there. One of the quotes that was said during the many, long, and often dull graduation speeches, I had the pleasure of listening to, that I actually did enjoy was that ‘everything we can see is reflected light.’ (Yea, okay, other than light sources itself… which even as a lighting designer aren’t near as interesting to look at as what they shine on). The speaker took that analogy further proposing that all of us are the sum of the reflections of each-others lives.

After this past weekend, I have to agree with him. Seeing so many familiar friendly faces, reminds me of what I have done, where I have been, and who I am. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to befriend such an array of individuals, whom I got to reconnect with, as well as the many more I didn’t get to see this weekend. So to make a graduation speech even cheesier, I realize now, that I think I shine brighter because of knowing you, all of you. =)

Alright, cut the sap? Sure… I agree. That’s enough of that!

Actual updates, as I led you to believe I would be talking about at the beginning of the blog: Really enjoying my new home. My apartment itself is about as ideal as I could have hoped for (living alone, and for the most part… LOVING it!). Enjoying my new job and new colleagues, and the overall experience of being out of school and being a working professional. Got plugged in with a local community theatre group up here- did one really fun show so far, and looking forward to future productions. Also have a couple of projects I started/re-started, which I’m sure I’ll be posting more about later.

All in all, life is good. Enjoying the feeling, and really thankful for the space (in every sense of the word) that I am in right now.
