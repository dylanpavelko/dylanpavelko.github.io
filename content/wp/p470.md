I am currently preparing for what I anticipate to be a multi-year endeavor. For the next several years I would like to study the different religions of the world– 1 religion, per year, at a time.

If you were to ask what my current spiritual beliefs are– I’d tell you I was raised, for the most part, Christian. My family celebrates all the regular Christian holiday’s, as a kid I went to church many Sunday’s. Heck, I’ve even been baptized Catholic! However throughout my childhood I was exposed to several different churches attending most often (slightly more than the catholic mission) a unitarian church. And different religious beliefs and tolerance was always very much a part of my upbringing.

But this study is not about me, I’m not feeling like a lost sheep trying to find Jesus, Allah, Buddha, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. I’m not looking to adopt or change my own religion/beliefs. Instead my hope is to better fundamentally understand the different belief systems of the people of the world. To learn about what different cultures value, what they consider a worthy life to be, and hopefully how that affects how they act in the world. I’m also interested in become more aware of what similarities different religions actually have.
