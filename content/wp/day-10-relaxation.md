We have been going pretty non-stop for the past 10 days, and so today we took the day off to just relax in this wonderful city!

We woke up late, and walked over to grab our complimentary breakfast. Delicious! Breakfast was a combination of more traditional western breakfast things (cereal, fruit, etc.) as well as Thai dishes, which we would probably consider to be a lunch. We got some of both, and it was all delicious. We then spent the rest of the morning floating around in our hotel’s pool. It was hot, but not unbearably so. And thankfully the humidity was not near as bad as it had been during some of our days in Hong Kong.

After the pool we grabbed some lunch, and took a small walk looking for some of the nearby Buddhist temples by our hotel. We didn’t actually find the one we were looking for, but we did find some that looked pretty interesting, and more interestingly, got to explore the area. Most of the streets are quite small, barely a two-way, and often no sidewalk. Nothing is too busy though, and everyone you see doesn’t seem to be in any extreme hurry. (This contrasted with the crowds of people running for the escalators on every MTR stop). It is definitely a nice change of pace.

Following our short stroll, we both had made reservations for an afternoon Thai massage, which was really relaxing! My legs more than anything really appreciated it after the abuse they have been taking over the past few days taking me all over Asia! The massage didn’t use any oils or lotions as a lot of the ones do in the U.S. but instead this herbal towel wrap, ball-thing that was heated with boiling water. The entire experience was great, from being picked up at our hotel, cool tea while they washed our feet, just a great afternoon!

All nice and comfortable, we took an open air truck (which is essentially riding in the bed of a truck) to a place that our hotel recommended for dinner, that was pretty tasty. Afterwards we headed back to the hotel as it was already getting late.

A rather short post today, as we didn’t really go out and do too much, but a very rewarding and relaxing day here in Chiang Mai.
