Walking around the city today, camera in hand, happened to stumble across a man climbing a sky scraper!

From the New York Times (I’m not sure why the SF Chronicle didn’t come up first in google):

The San Francisco Police Department identified the man as Daniel Goodwin, 54, otherwise known as “SpiderDan,” who had previously climbed the Sears Tower in Chicago. Mr. Goodwin was cited with two misdemeanors and later released from a police station in downtown San Francisco.

[A press release on Mr. Goodwin’s web site ](http://skyscraperman.com/?page_id=932)said he made today’s ascent to “call attention to our nation’s continued vulnerability to attacks of terrorism upon our skyscrapers” and to “increase public awareness of cancer.”

[Footage of the ascent](http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/san_francisco&id=7653155) showed Mr. Goodwin using what appeared to be suction cups to ascend the exterior glass of the 58-story residential structure,[Millennium Tower](http://www.millenniumtowersf.com/).
