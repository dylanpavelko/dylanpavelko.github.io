Our lat full day in Rome we‚Äôd actually technically be spending much of it in another country, Vatican City. Which is a stones throw away from our apartment.

We woke up relatively early (though not that early) to beat some of the long lines that form for the Vatican. We decided we were going to start with St. Peters Basilica and even though it was Wednesday, we had heard the Pope was not in town so he wouldn‚Äôt be giving his weekly mass and thus hopefully not as bad as crowds. As we were walking towards St. Peters Square though we kept on having random semi-sketchy guides tell us that the church was closed and they could get us ‚Äútickets with no lines‚Äù for the museum. We kind of brushed them aside, but as we approached St. Peters square we saw they had the metal detectors out and a huge group of people were in the square. As it turns out, the Pope WAS in town and he was out with a bunch of other cardinals doing some mass for all the pilgrims. It was pretty neat to see, if for no other reason that when all the people back home ask me jokingly ‚Äúdid you see the pope?‚Äù I can say‚Ä¶ as a matter of fact, I DID!

So after sticking around there for long enough to hear the English section, we took advantage of the distracted crowds to make our way to the Vatican Museum. Another case where we had bought tickets in advance, and I really don‚Äôt get why everyone doesn‚Äôt do this? There was essentially no line, as opposed to a LONG line for people without our pre-purchased tickets.

The Vatican Museums themselves were quite impressive. Similar to the Lourve, but more densely populated with stolen art. The pieces were magnificent, but it was almost overwhelming at times where to look! The variety of art though was really impressive, from marble statues, to greek and Egyptian artifacts, to tile work, to tapestries, to famous paintings‚Ä¶ the Vatican has it all! We did make it to see the major attractions at the Vatican Museum, including the School of Athens painting which was much larger than I expected.

Then we exited into the Sistine Chapel, which unfortunately had no photography was allowed. While having detailed and ornate paintings on the ceiling is not that unique at the Vatican, I think the size and scale (and of course the fact that it was done by Michelangelo) makes it a very awe-inspiring moment. The ceiling and the massive painting of Judgement day creates a very colorful surrounding. Someone may have snuck in a picture too!

Interestingly the bottom (we‚Äôll say third) section of the church is painted to look like curtains that are drawn covering possibly additional paintings. Part of me wonders if there were grander plans for those walls or if it was intentional.

Thanks to the Rick Steve‚Äôs book we then casually exited the Sistine Chapel using the guided-tours only exit which drops you off on the front door step of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica. (Which was nice because the line to get through the metal detectors, which we already had gone through for the museum, wrapped around more than half the square‚Ä¶ which if you have never been or seen it is VERY long.)

The Basilica was ENORMOUS! What an impressive building, and as awe-inspiring as it is today I can only imagine how the worshippers must have felt hundreds of years ago entering this mammoth structure. It truly a depiction of the devotion of generations of Catholics and Christians to the worship of Jesus Christ.

Ironically, while being surrounded with so many impressive peices of art and architecture, I think my favorite aspect of the Basillica was at the center of the very back one of the only stained glass window peices in the Basillica shined brightly of a dove, seemingly flying in through the window back lit with the rays of the sun. It was that simplicity amidst all of the extravagance that stood out to me.

After the getting our fill of the Vatican we actually finished with more time than expected, and grabbed a late lunch of pizza before planning out the rest of our day.

We decided to split up, the girls and Brian (Maui) went back for more shopping, and the other Brian and I went exploring at Piazza Popolo and the Pincio gardens, or maybe it was the Borghese gardens park area. I‚Äôm not really sure. Eventually though we wandered our way to where we would be meeting up with the other half of the group at the Trevi Fountain. Throughout this section of the day I had actually forgot my camera! But no worries, because there weren‚Äôt really too many new sights except the Trevi Fountain which ‚Ä¶ was covered in scaffolding for renovations! Nooo! So Sad! üôÅ I had actually known about it in advance though, so wasn‚Äôt crushed when I turned the corner and saw the fountain drained. They actually had this kind of walk-way set up over where the fountain normally is and it was kind of neat in it‚Äôs own way to get up closer to the statues then you normally could. And heck, I still threw a coin over my shoulder into the dry fountain ‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm gonna count it!

Once meeting up with the rest of the group we made our way to a small little restaurant that my coworker Adriana had suggested to me, and wow! That place is SO GOOD! Everyone raved about their food! I had Spaghetti Amatriciana again ‚Ä¶ and while the place yesterday had better bacon this place had better pasta! Then for my main course I had Carpaccio. Which I kind of thought was something other than it was. It was a dish of raw beef that is very thinly sliced with arugula and parmesan cheese and some marinade. But even that was delicious! When in Rome, right? üôÇ

After a leisurely, delicious, and enjoyable dinner we made our way back home to get organized before tomorrow, when we will be packing our bags (okay, hopefully we do this mostly tonight) and getting on a plane for Munich!

P.S.: As I write this apparently it is starting to rain again, as I‚Äôve seen a few flashes of lightning and heard a couple crashes of thunder! What an exciting end, I love lightning!  
P.P.S: Ok now as I am starting to work on photos it is POURING RAIN. We have totally lucked out on weather during this trip. It just barely lightly rained on us this morning, but not enough to dampen our spirits, and if anything probably helped it stay cooler during out time in the Vatican where long pants are part of the dress code.
