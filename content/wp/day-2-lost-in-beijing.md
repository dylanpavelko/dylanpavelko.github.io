We got up early in the morning, to catch our hotel’s shuttle to the air port (5AM). Luckily, since I’m not too adjusted to the time zone yet, this wasn’t too challenging.

We went through customs which was much more relaxed than in the U.S. (you get to keep your shoes on, no need to take stuff out of your bag, and just walk through a metal detector) and then all got some breakfast as we waited for out flight.

We were flying Hong Kong Airlines, which may be my new favorite airline. They play calm music during take off and landing, we got great seats, they had fog/steam blowing out of the top vents (just enough to make it not feel dry, not so much that if felt humid). But by far the best thing was this super high-energy, cheesey, Disney-esque song they’d play at the beginning and end of the flight. Sadly, I can’t find a version online!

When we arrived at the airport we got through customs quickly because the entire airport seemed empty. It was quite an unusual sight to walk around a terminal in the middle of the day and have it be deserted.

We got on a train from the Airport to near where our hotel was and once we got to the end of the line started walking to our hotel. It is a funny blend of things that are modern, and things that are a little out-of-place for a modern city. (Hard to describe). The way we ended up walking was wrong! So we turned around and went back. We were using a small google map print-out, and a downloadable map on my phone to navigate. Neither were really the same, in terms of street labels (some are in English others are in Chinese) as well as where some streets even laid-out! In any case the intrepid traveler’s that we are, we found the correct way eventually and started what should be a medium length walk to our hotel. The walk was interesting, and felt quite unlike anywhere I’ve been before. Cars drive all over, including on the sidewalk where they try to park (and do!). Everyone just goes where and how they need to, and some how without hitting each other. Time to cross the street? All right, go! Eventually we turn down this smaller alley that our hotel should be at, and head down it. It’s narrow and very “local” looking. Later we learned that this is area is known for its Hutongs (sort of like alley’s) and is more traditional of what China looked like long ago. The area is now being preserved to retain historical accuracy. There are a lot of public bathrooms (which smell quite a bit) spaced out all over but surprisingly close to one another for being a seemingly residential area. They alley way is actually quite pretty, and calm compared to the main streets. We pass a schoolyard where the kids are out playing recess, many of them ping-pong.

Eventually though we realized that we can’t find out hotel! We found a hostel with someone who speaks some English, and after looking at our address tells us we are in the wrong place, and should take a taxi to this other area. She circles part of the address of where we should be. Glad we got to see this cool area, but disappointed we were in the wrong place we begin to search out a taxi.

We find one and, after some language-barrier confusion, the driver embarks on one of the scariest taxi rides I’ve ever been on! He points out an alley way eventually telling us our hotel is down there. Okay…

We walk down this alley, which seems much more mainstream and touristy! (At least compared to where we just came from) It ends up winding to this river/lake which was really pretty, but not our hotel. We found a map of this area. We find where we think are (or at least I do) our hotel should be. All of these public touristy maps have a ‘You are Here’ arrow. But after walking and seeing a few of them we realized… they aren’t all correct? Great! Anyways, we begin another long trek to where our hotel should be. This was also a pretty walk, but it didn’t lead to our hotel either! Now completely lost, hot, and all mildly frustrated we turned around and started asking people where our hotel was by pointing to our hotel address (which was printed in both English and Chinese). Receiving mostly confused looks and some pointing off in the distance we continued in that direction.

Then we stopped and asked at a small stop where we met Denis, our savior! Denis wasn’t sure where our hotel was either, but spoke some English, and the shopkeeper told him our hotels were near each other, and that we were very lucky to stop and ask here while he was there! (This she told him in and he translated for us) Lucky indeed, we followed him and we all shared a taxi, Denis giving instructions in Mandarin to the driver. I think we were all slightly skeptical about getting in this taxi with a complete stranger, but he seemed genuine, and we really had few better options. Turns out Denis worked in Houston for a year at some big oil company, and was quite friendly. He himself was only visiting Beijing to apply for another U.S. Visa. The driver took us back to where we started from and then… got lost himself! Luckily though he called the hotel for us and got instructions. Making some crazy U-turns in the process, he finally turned down a small alleyway down an apparently famous street (which we had definitely walked down, but failed to see the tiny alley way, as it looks more like a space between two buildings than a road).

We finally found it! But for some reason our driver wasn’t convinced at first. After some passionate conversation we finally convinced him it was, got out, very thankful to both the driver and Denis, and took a well-earned rest in our hotel.

We ended up seeing a lot of things we wouldn’t have, and I think we were glad we did see the areas we did explore, but it ate up a lot of the time and we ended up having to skip something we all wanted to see, the Temple of Heaven.

After our refreshing break at our hotel, we decided to head out in search for some dinner, and hopefully pick up some souvenirs. As we started walking to one of the subway stops, it was (almost) humorous to walk by blocks and buildings we had definitely walked by prior in our search for our hotel. If only we had known how close we were! We didn’t really see anything worth stopping to buy, so we went to our subway station to go find a place that was suggested for dinner. After realizing we couldn’t purchase our tickets at the automated ticket machine, but had to go to the ticket booth, we were on our way. Interestingly you buy 1 ticket per trip at a fixed price, but tickets you buy at any one station can only be used at *that* station (even though it’s the same price for any station). To make a long story short where we ended up was again, not where we wanted to be. So after some more investigation, trying to and failing to grab a taxi, we chose a new dinner destination and, being the experienced subway riders we now are, hopped back on the train.

The subways in the evening were **much** more crowded than before, when the doors opened, the train would already look packed, but you all just rush forward and cram yourselves into the masses. Clearly any perception of personal space does not exist here.

After asking a tourist info desk, we did finally find the place we were looking for to try Beijing’s famous Peking Duck. The restaurant, Da Dong Roast Duck, was fancy, and more modern-style that traditional (we were probably under-dressed).

The duck tasted delicious, and after getting a lesson in the ways to eat it, we all had an enjoyable, relaxing dinner after a rather confusing day.

After dinner we bought some water and successfully (on our first try, no less) made it back to our hotel. Too bad it will be our last night here, I could imagine spending a week here and getting very familiar with this neighborhood.

Generally we found the people in Beijing didn’t speak any English, and mostly just went about their business. We did get a few stares as we definitely stood out as Westerner’s. Here much sore than in Hong Kong so far, I definitely feel like a minority.

Walking around some interesting observations: no homeless people, same in Hong Kong actually, to be seen. Though I get the feeling many of the people, especially in the Hutong area are quite poor.

There are a lot of police, security, traffic wardens, and grounds keepers employed all over, wherever you go. Not so much doing anything, just watching and being a notable presence.

Pollution wise, most of the day it was so-so. It wasn’t clear, but it didn’t feel as overwhelming as what built up in the sky by evening. We felt like we could taste it. Mostly though throughout the day we just noticed these floating pieces of substance (kind of looked like small whiffs of cotton) floating literally all over the city. Later we learned they were pollen from the willow trees.

As our day was now at an end we all took showers, or tried to, but discovered there was no more hot water!! What!?

In any case, tomorrow we are meeting a tour guide who will be with us for the next two days. I think we are all quite pleased with the idea of having a local help us navigate the confusing streets of Beijing.

It’s worth noting, while it may sound like we had a pretty hard day, which we did, it was quite the adventure and I think we all enjoyed taking in the sights and scenes that we have gotten to see. Certainly I have never been any place even close to what Beijing is like.

I’m off to go try to take a cold shower and get some shut-eye on our very firm mattresses.
