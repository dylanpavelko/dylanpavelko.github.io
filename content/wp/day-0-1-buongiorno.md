Buongiorno!

We made it to Rome! It was a never ending day, where I felt like we were always stuck in morning. Waking up before the sun, we caught a morning flight to Toronto where we would connect to Rome … landing there about the same time as our departure from San Francisco just a day later. Confusing? That’s how my brain feels, I keep referring to the past 24 hours as “this morning”, only to realize that no one knows when I’m talking about because I keep referring to different times. Long story short: JET LAG!

The flights were fine, didn’t sleep all that much, but tried to rest as best I could. Strangely we went through immigration in both Canada and Rome, and neither places stamped my passport. While it was convenient because it made it faster for me… I kind of wanted the stamps, as dorky as that sounds. Oh well!

When we finally got to Rome we decided to just get a cab to our place, which ended up being not too pricey split 4 ways. Rome is fairly hot, and muggy/humid which makes it feel even warmer. There is an occasional breeze though that will pick up and provide some relief.

Our cab ride was neat, as it was our first look at Rome/Italy. As we got closer and closer to the city of Rome you could definitely tell you were in a European city based on the architecture. The other unique thing about this trip was the driving. Whizzing down the freeway at a pretty decent speed (I’m not actually sure what we were doing as the speed is just in km/hr here) our taxi driver would casually drift back and forth between lanes, or for an extended period of time just decide that driving between the two lanes would suit him fine! Traffic in general is funny here, later as we started wandering on foot it became clear everyone just kind of does their thing. Many intersections don’t have dedicated pedestrian signals, so you just kind of cross the street when you feel the time is right.

Our cab driver dropped us off at the Piazza del Risorgimento, which is right next the place we are staying, as well as the wall of the vatican. We can actually see the Dome St. Peter’s Basilica from our room.While we waited for our check-in time, their conveniently was a restaurant right next door that we decided to have our first italian meal at. The food was pretty decent for being pretty close to several tourist traps, and we enjoyed taking time just to relax, eat, and people watch while we waited. We were then actually able to drop off our luggage at our place which was nice, and then set off on our priority 1 mission: gelato!

I got pistachio/nutella/banana, which was delicious! And then we walked over to checkout the square in the vatican. It was surreal to see this spot which in my head feels more like a set from a movie than an actual place, but then have it be real, and be standing in it was just pretty cool. It made me very excited for the next two weeks of sight seeing!

After that we decided to escape the heat and rest a bit in our apartment, and I used to the time to write part of this blog post.

We then went out on a quest for PIZZA! We found a really close pizza place to our apartment that had good reviews. We all ordered some pizza and then ate in the piazza outside of our place (and near the pizza shop). Amazing! There was this pesto pizza (basil, garlic, tomato, and some kind of cheese) on thin crust… so delicious! There was also this water fountain with water constantly running out of a spicket that people would go up to, press their hand against it, water would shoot up, and they would drink straight from it. Thirsty we followed suit and it’s strange to say, but even the water is delicious in Italy. As Californian’s in the middle of a drought though it was a bizarre sight, to just see potable water constantly flowing on to the ground.

After finishing our dinner and people watching we went in search of a market to stock up our fridge and then our way back home couldn’t help but stop at another gelato stop (this time I opted for a mango flavor) and eat our new favorite eating spot, the piazza across the street, before heading back up to our apartment to crash relatively early as we are a bit jet lag.

Tomorrow, Florence!
