Well it appears it has been nearly a year since I last updated this blog. A far cry from the almost monthly regularity I had been trying to up keep previously! I must have been keeping busy which after a moment of reflection… sounds about right. Working hard (got a promotion!), moved out of my apartment and into a room at a friends house, and now as I return to my blog am about to embark on another epic adventure!

With the same set of worldy traveler companions, I’ll be embarking on a journey to the People’s Republic of China’s special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau; their nations capital, Beijing; as well as Thailand’s capital Bangkok, and former capital Chiang Mai!

I have decided to self-title this trip ‘Looking for Buddha’ and once again plan on documenting this adventure via my blog with pictures and a narrative of our experiences. To filter my blog to see posts related to only this trip use the following filter link– [filter only for ‘Looking for Buddha’ trip posts](http://www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/?cat=14)!

Our plane will be jetting off in the early morning May 10th, and you can expect semi-frequent (as internet access allows) posts on how things are going, what we are seeing, tasting, and experiencing! =)

P.S.: May the 4th be with you!
