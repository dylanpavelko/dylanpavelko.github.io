Sleeping in just a bit (read: *actually* getting 8 hours of sleep) we hopped on the MTR to go back in to Central Hong Kong to catch a different Ferry this day to Cheung Chau Island (which is part of Hong Kong). It just so happens to be the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, which is a culmination of events including the Parade of Floating Colors that aligns with Buddha’s Birthday (which was today, Happy Birthday Buddha! And is a national holiday). This however translates into a **lot** of tourists going to the island to visit. Normally the island has a population of just 30,000 but during the Bun Festival an additional 70,000 visitors come. We got in a fairly long queue on the main island and caught the next ferry over to Cheung Chau Island.

Even though we arrived before the parade was supposed to begin, there were already many people, as well as what appeared to be processions (lion dancers, people carrying colored flags, etc.) down the parade route. After the fact, I now believe it is likely they were just in the process of all getting to the starting point and why not get there in full spirit!

The island was very much what you’d expect from a small island off the coast of Asia, strange smelling shops, small alleys (this was even more so because no cars are allowed on this island, so streets really don’t have to be very big).

We eventually got to where the starting point was going to be, and saw a few things worth mentioning.

The first: the bun towers, based on a 100-year-old tradition, the Bun Festival ends with an event called Bun Scrambling where climbers race up these gigantic towers made of buns to try to grab the highest buns they can. Formerly being made out of bamboo and real buns, after a major accident several years ago the event now comprises of steel towers and plastic buns. But the tradition lives on! The towers were on display at the parade starting area, but the actual scrambling wouldn’t take place till about midnight, so we didn’t get to see that.

Second: Right next to the starting point was a Taoist temple, for who the festival is actually honoring (it just happens to line up with Buddha’s birthday, which is convenient since it is a national holiday here in Hong Kong). The temple was neat, some interesting statue work, and architecture, and a little bit removed away from all the loud music. Most prominent though was the incense which they had many **massive** sticks of incense burning. This area certainly was stimulating our senses between the colorful sights, the loud drums, the smell of the incense, and the hot, humid air, all we needed was to find some tasty food to complete the experience! (Spoiler: We did!)

Third/Last but not least,: The Parade of Floating colors, which highlight is the these small children that are literally carried through the entire parade route. Each one is dressed differently (likely to represent different parts of Hong Kong culture) but it was quite impressive of these little kids to have the stamina to stay standing the entire time, not to mention in this hot humid weather, and be carried around for what was probably a few hours!

We saw the beginning of the parade but realized we didn’t have the best viewing angle, so decided to try to push down the parade route a little bit to get a better angle. This resulted in us going down several small alley ways and shortly there after reaching the other side of the island! Deciding we were then far enough away from the parade, that we should just go back at the end to see the end of the parade we decided to put our feet in the ocean water (or at least Kaitlin and I did). It was amazing! Even though it was raining on us, the water (which was really clear due to what I am guessing is coarser, heavier sand) was so nice, and refreshing! The perfect temperature. Perhaps this would be a great spot to retire!

After drying off our feet, we decide to walk back in to the parade route and see if we could see anything better. We saw a few things go by, but since our view still wasn’t really that great, we went back in to the alley ways to explore. Kaitlin showed us this tea shop that was really neat, and had tea tasting (a little like wine tasting, but with tea!). I ended up buying some green tea and a special free-leaf teapot as my first real souvenir for the trip. Navigating around this island is quite interesting, because no cars (other than emergency vehicles) are allowed on the island, the “roads” in-between buildings are quite small and the entire neighborhood feels like an alley-maze. It was quite neat to just wander down the streets and kind of get lost. I say kind of, because the island is small you couldn’t really get too lost.

Hungry, we started buying some of the food on the street which was all quite delicious. Starting with some of the famous buns (of course, for the bun festival) which had the character for peace written on them. Then some crispy potato-stick thing (kind of like fair food only better), a frozen fruit stick, and by far the best was this fruit shaved ice we got for dessert one half-mango, half-strawberry and one guava (which we all decided was our favorite)! Instead of being blended ice with fruit flavoring, it was made from giant blocks of the fruit juice, which was then shaved into thin slivers.

Keeping track of time, we headed over to the Ferry station ending our time at Cheung Chau; happy we got to see, do, and taste all that we did! When we did get to the station there was a massively long line to get on the next ferry. So after waiting in the hot humid sun for probably around a half hour (which felt longer), we were headed back to Hong Kong Island.

Once there, we grabbed some dinner real quick at this very western, but delicious salad place. Nice to eat a big salad, since that doesn’t seem to be common here. And then we were off to go meet up with some of Kaitlin’s friends from work at the Ozone bar, which tout’s the title of the ‘tallest bar in the world’ being on the 118th floor of the Ritz Carlton in Kowloon. (Kowloon is an area within Hong Kong, across from the main island).

The view was beautiful, the drinks were tasty, her friends were hilarious, which all made for a fun evening. The staff at the bar though was surprisingly not as considerate as you would expect for such a posh place. As 9 o’clock rolled around we decided to leave, partly because we all wanted an early night and partly because the dress code was taking in to effect. So we all took the MTR back to the hotel that all the Disney employees lived at and got to have our first early night since we’ve landed!
