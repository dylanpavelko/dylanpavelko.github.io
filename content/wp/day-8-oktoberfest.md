Okay, so the first part of the day we slept in. We went to the market to get some food. I bought a salad since I felt like I hadn’t eaten anything but meat, pretzels, and beer since I landed in Germany. We then went in to town/Marienpatz and walked around/got another lunch/snack kind of thing. I ordered a Bavarian snack plate, and I’ll have you know I tried everything on the plate! That said, I actually didn’t enjoy most of it. Weird meat things, and some strong cheeses. But hey, got to try it right?

Brian had a friend/coworker who had extra tickets in one of the tents at Oktoberfest so at 5 o’clock we met up with them at the Lowerhaus tent. If I described the atmosphere on the fairgrounds as fun in yesterday’s post it hardly compares to what goes on inside the tent.</span>

The tent has huge crowds trying to get in, so we were lucky that we were able to get wrist-bands to get us easy-access in the tent, once inside the crowds were almost just as massive. The first misconception here to clear up is the use of the word tent. I use that word because that’s what they are called, but they are really much more than a tent. It’s a giant two-story wooden structure with electricity, windows, bathrooms, kitchen, a live band, and rows upon rows of long bench-style tables.

The place is packed full of people who all in their drunken stupor seem to be friends. You can’t really tell where one group ends and another begins.

Our table was on the balcony of the second level so we went up there and got our first round of beers flowing. Honestly I don’t really recall what the beer was, other than delicious. I also had half a rotisserary chicken, which was fantastic, and another beer. Oof, two beers at Oktoberfest means two liters of beer so …yup, I was drunk. But if you don’t get drunk at Oktoberfest, you aren’t doing it right.

The style of drinking though here is so different than in the states. I feel like in the U.S. people go out drinking to get drunk, and “party” in a club. Here people just drink to have a good time. We arm wrestled (I lost to Jenn), we chatted with our neighbors, and probably one of the most surprising and fun elements of the tent was the music. There was a live band that was playing songs every now and again… but not necessarily traditional Bavarian music, or modern German music, or the club kind of music you here in American drinking holes, no they were playing ‘sing along style’ classics that were mostly American/English artists. And at least half the tent ends up standing up on their table benches and belting along with the band. Somehow when everyone is drunk the lyrics are easier to remember.

Not really sure what else to write to try and capture the experience so I’ll make sure to add some photo’s and a video clip I took, but really just encourage everyone to go experience it for yourself. All ages, even if you don’t really like beer, you should go to Oktoberfest, because it’s a blast.
