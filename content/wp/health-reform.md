I am sitting watching CNN’s coverage of the final debates before the health care reform. And I figured might as well weigh in with my opinion. (Mostly I just figured it would be a good way to figure out exactly where I stand.)

By the sounds of it the bill will pass, but only with a very close, very partisan vote.

I think everyone’s opinion of where they stand on the bill greatly varies depending on they think “How will it affect me?” Will it make my coverage decline? Will it mean I pay less for health insurance? More?

In my case, even after listening to all the back and forth, I still don’t really know. I am currently part of that static that makes up the number of uninsured americans. I know that in this package it will extend the age that students can be to be still under their parents insurance plan. Which is great for thousands of young americans! Unfortunately, my mom doesn’t have a health insurance plan either. So I’m still unsure of what if any changes will be coming my way any time soon.

I agree, and understand, that everyone (Democrat and Republican) think Health Care Reform is important and needed. And frankly I don’t know if anyone fully understands what this bill is actually going to do. Just little facts here and there about the bill seem to emerge. But it does strike me as odd that we are the only industrialized nation that doesn’t provide some sort of health care for everyone. Additionally in a recent report I believe USA was ranked 16th on level of health care. I’m not sure how the study was ranked, but I think those two facts speak to the fact that we must be doing something wrong.

So in my opinion, I’d say: PASS IT! I doubt it will be perfect, but what is.
