Bonjour! … or as I’m writing this Bonsoir!

We made it safely to France! It was quite the journey, with a few challenges, but it all ended up well and was an enjoyable evening (in big thanks to our local Kaitlin! =) )

\[NOTE: Haven’t proof read this yet, will go back and do later. Just wanted to get this up here\]

Getting to SFO went fairly smoothly, small crowds, security went fast. So far so good. The good luck kept going on our flight, even with a couple babies sitting around us, we were able to have a pretty enjoyable flight. (As enjoyable as sitting in a cramped chair for 12 hours can be). Food wasn’t bad, our row had extra leg room, the flight attendants assumed we were french (oh-hoh-hoh &lt;- french laugh).

After getting a pretty moderate amount of rest we finally touched down in Charles De Gaulle Airport (both take off and landing went as smooth as I’ve ever experienced, I might add). There our luck and planning made a bit of a turn for the worse. Getting through customs was a huge pain. Not because it was a complicated process, or we had to go through a rigorous screening. Just because the line situation was badly managed, with too few people processing passports. And took way longer then we should have.

It was at this time that we started being concerned that we would miss our first main event. Going to Disneyland Paris to see our friend Kaitlin in the parade!

Once getting through customs we the entered what (unfortunately) ties for first place as the most stressful part of the day: Figuring out the transportation to Chessy (where Disneyland Paris is). There were tons of kiosk, the train route we wanted to take apparently is also named something else. Long lines. Wasted time. It was here where we ate up the critical time we needed to go get checked in to our hotel and make it to Disneyland. We finally boarded with an arrival time of when the parade was suppose to start (and we still had to check in to our hotel with our luggage). Finally we got to our hotel destination, only to realize we don’t know exactly where this place is. Only the address. Our GPS on our ‘travel phone’ wasn’t working, we were tired, hot, smelly, lost, and confused. Finally we found our hotel and was able to check-in. By this time it was when Laura and I were suppose to be meeting up with Kaitlin at Disneyland. We were able to get in touch with her and rather then us try and deal with the chaos again, she decided to come meet up with us at our hotel.

From here on, our trip took a turn back to the good side! (And with any luck … will keep it up). We actually got a pretty nice hotel room. I’d post a pic, but I didn’t take one before we threw our stuff all over and made it a mess. We then walked around the small town we were staying in. Very cute and quaint. All the buildings look very european. Oh… wait a second!

Checked out some local shopping, ate a delicious tapas dinner in this pretty court yard. Bought some random food and beverage supplies, went back to the hotel room and de-stressed/planned out the following day’s final details. And ended the evening with a night walk. Where I snapped this pic with my point and shoot. Lesson learned: bring your dslr everywhere no matter what!
