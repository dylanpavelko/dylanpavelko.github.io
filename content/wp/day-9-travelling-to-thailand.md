We slept in again, since we didn’t really have anything on our morning agenda other than packing, which was quite enjoyable. And then spent the rest of the day packing and grabbing some brunch at the super market. Before we knew it, the time had come to say good-bye to Hong Kong, and catch our shuttle to the airport.

After navigating the airport like the travel experts we are becoming, we had plenty of down time before our flight, which I used to do some major catch up on my blog entries. When the announcement finally did come that our plane was boarding we headed to our terminal where, there wasn’t actually a plane?! Confused all the passengers ended up walking out on to this shuttle/bus thing that drove of us out on the tar-mat to where our plane was parked, and we walked up the stairs to the main door. After a unusual boarding we were off, and on our way to Thailand.

The flight wasn’t too long, and the clouds were really pretty (perhaps because we were in a smaller plane and we were not as high above them this flight). Soon enough, we were landing at Chiang Mai International Airport in the Kingdom of Thailand. The airport was pretty small, and much to our pleasure most everyone seemed to speak some English!

We caught a taxi, which was super cheap, to our hotel and started checking-in. We’re staying at The Rim Resort, which is pretty moderately priced (cheap by US standards) and so far it has been amazing! During check-in you get to sit down and are served refreshing tea. Our room is right next to the pool, which is small but really tranquil. And just in general the room was very relaxing.

Actually, Thailand in general has already been relaxing, perhaps because everyone speaks English, but more than that the people also just seem so friendly and hospitable. Whenever you are done with a transaction everyone bows/nods to each other. Perhaps its just as routine as our ‘please’ and ‘thank you’s but it comes across as sincere.

Our hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to the night bazar, which feeling rested enough we decided to take advantage of. As we started to drive though, we noticed some raindrops start to fall! Worried, since neither of us had brought our umbrella’s that night, we were pleased to find that between the tarps all the shop keepers were ready with, and the warm Thai night, the rain wasn’t really a problem. (I wore my sandals, shorts, and a T-shirt all night).

The night bazar was colorful, and full of things that looked quite unique, until you walked down and saw an almost identical booth a few blocks away. Either way it was fun, and we both picked up several gifts that we thought were quite neat here.

Also in between one of the shopping area’s we walked past an area where there was a sort of club with a bunch of ‘lady boys’ trying to lure people in. Lady boys are, exactly what they sound like… ladies, who are actually boys. I had heard about this previous to my trip, and was under the impression they were easily mistaken to be female. At least this group of lady boys were quite clearly … lady BOYS.

We grabbed dinner at a place that looked okay, it was actually hard to find anything that looked to appealing to us in this area as I get the feeling it’s primarily a tourist shopping spot. So the food was ok, but not really anything spectacular, despite coming in a real coconut and pineapple.

We went by 7/11 and grabbed some Thai beers, took a tuk-tuk back home to our hotel (which is an exhilarating experience, where you just don’t think about safety, and then lounged the rest of the evening away on our poolside patio. I think we are going to like this place!
