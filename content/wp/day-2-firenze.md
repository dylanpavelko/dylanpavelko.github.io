Our second day (and first real full day) in Italy was an early start for us, as we had to go catch a metro in order to catch a morning train to travel north to the city of Florence (Firenze). The metro system here is pretty straight forward (plus it helps having Jessica and Jenn are already very familiar with navigating Italy). With their navigation skills we quickly got to the train station and grabbed a bite to eat before hopping on a 1.5 hour ride. The ride was nice, and actually quite scenic. Italy is fairly green, and the country side had all these random packs of sheep. I kept trying to snap a good picture but being moving in a train, and being behind glass, I honestly wasn’t able to capture anything worth sharing.

Arriving in Florence we started to head down the cobble stone paths, and marveled at how just iconic everything looked. I have to constantly remind myself, these aren’t facades, this isn’t a theatre set… this is the real deal! That said it didn’t take long until I noticed though, Florence seems like a tourist site more than anything else. Every now and then we’d end up off the beaten path and found what may have been an area the true residents of Florence lived, but mostly it was just packs of tourists bustling around.

Our first real destination was the Duomo, an iconic cathedral built in Florence, famous for a massive (especially for the time) dome that sits on top of the cathedral, but really what is more impressive is it’s enormous front which is intricately carved out of green, white, and pink marble, along with other sculptures and illustrations. Very impressive, even if a little overly ornate. We circled the cathedral looking for the entrance, but either it was closed at the time, or we were oblivious, because we couldn’t find it. Nor could we find the entrance to the Duomo Museum, both of which I had read online were free. Perhaps this was because the outside of the Museum was undergoing some major renovation.

One of the fun things about this area was the church bells that would toll, I flipped my camera in to video mode and while the video is shaky and not worth watching I extracted the audio from it and will upload it here for all of you to enjoy!

After feeling satisfied with what we could see of the area, we began to head south, somewhat just wandering (Jessica, Jenn, and Brian grabbed a morning helping of gelato), though in general we were headed in the direction of this recommended sandwich shop All’antico Vinaio. It was this total ‘hole in the wall’ kind of place with 4 Italian guys goofing around making sandwiches. But there was consistently a line, and no wonder… they were delicious! Across the street (which was more like a single lane cobble stone path than a road) was a similar store-front with the same name. Every so many minutes, a man would walk across the street carrying a new batch of fresh bread, or some more chunks of meat to restock the restaurant supplies. I’m not sure if it started out as a small market, or a small sandwich shop but they clearly had a great thing going, as the line only continued to grow as we devoured our sandwiches. (Mine was a roasted ham, with artichoke spread, tomatoes, mozzarella, and arugula). Yum!

Afterwards we had a little bit of time to kill before our ticket reservation for the Uffizi gallery, so we went in search of a cappuccino for the girls to help with jet-lag. On the way I saw this little plaza that had some neat architecture so I encouraged the group that we pop-in, and see what it was. What a happy accident! At first it just was a cool little courtyard, in what is probably now another museum, but at one point in time likely some rich persons house. Then as we went into the first “chamber”/courtyard area that connects to the main entrance there with this small fountain and then spontaneously this group of italian men circled in the corner of the area began singing. Because of the closed off nature of the courtyard the space had awesome acoustics, and the men seemed like quite talented singers. I quickly again flipped over to movie mode on my camera and tried to capture a bit. They went on to sing a second song and it was a really neat experience. I think they were likely just tourists as well, maybe on a choir trip, and taking advantage of testing out the acoustics of this space. Here is a sample (where the audio quality of the recording does not do the ad-hoc performance justice) but will give you a sense of how awesome it was.

Earlier in the day there was some street performer playing Andrew Botcelli’s ‘Good Night’ on an instrument, so now I was humming all this music as we continued to explore this city.

We finally made it to the Uffizzi and were glad that we had pre-purchased tickets once we saw how long the line was to purchase them at the museum. The museum was moderately sized as far as museums go. And focused on the artwork of the Italian Renicanse. Which essentially means mostly fairly life-like paintings of christian scenes… again, and again, and again. There were also a fair number of statues, though the emphasis was definitely placed on the paintings. Two of the most famous were Botticelli’s *Birth of Venus*, and *Primavera*.

From the museum we got our first look at the river that runs through Florence, and the Ponte Vechio, which was our next destination. After a short walk, with some neat architecture, we crossed the famous bridge, now lined with jewelry shops. On the other side we stopped for, you guessed it, gelato! This time I got strawberry, and carmel. (I’ve never actually thought ***I*** could gain weight by eating, but on this trip, I just may!)

We then made a trek up to the Piazzo Michelangelo, which was a little bit of a walk, and after being on our feet all day already was tiring, but the views were worth it in my opinion. From the height it is at you can get a good view of the river, Ponte Vechio, the Duomo, and all the villages of Florence.

After hiking back down we went on our quest for dinner, we looked up a place using the trip advisor app, and unfortunately after thinking we just couldn’t find it, discovered it didn’t look like they were open anymore. So we found a second choice that was more out of convenience than anything else, but it ended up being pretty good. I had pasta carbonara. It was good, but honestly not as good as everything else we’d been having recently.

Our train, to take us back to Rome, would be departing soon. So after dinner we headed back to the train station. Unfortunately the train ended up being a little delayed, so we hung out longer than expected in the train station. We got home probably close to 11, Brian and I filled up our water bottles at the delicious water fountain in the piazza and then headed up. We all pretty much crashed from a long day. Tomorrow we are planning on sleeping in a little later!
