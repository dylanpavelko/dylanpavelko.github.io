We were all quite tired so had no troubles going to bed, but I ended up waking up at around 4 AM and couldn’t really go back to sleep. After a few hours of trying, it was now a proper time to get up.

We got ready to head out to explore Berlin, as the first item on our agenda was to do a historic walking tour of the city. We decided that we’d just find something easy for breakfast close to the tour meeting site so headed in the direction of the closest tram station. I must say that having data (thank you T=Mobile) has made navigating this trip so much easier than my previous adventures!

After eating breakfast at just a simple cafe, we met up with our guide and began a four-hour walk around the city.

Our guide was Barnaby, from England, and was over 6’8″ (I don’t think we got an exact height). The tour was great and informative, and while the landmarks were impressive having the context of what/why/when/how the landmarks became significant really helps create a better foundation for appreciating Berlin.

Much of the tour, and as I now better understand it revolve around the two greatest conflicts in our world’s history. First the rise, terror, and the defeat of Hitler and the Nazi’s; and second, the central role that West Berlin played in the Cold War.

Even monuments and establishments that weren’t directly correlated with one of the two events was almost always contextualized by one of them (ex: one of the few buildings not destroyed during the bombing of WWII). We saw where the infamous book burning took place, with a unique memorial skylight looking into a room with empty bookshelves on the square. This square (and library) was where people such as Einstein and the Brothers Grimm studied/taught.

We then walked to above where Hitler’s bunker was, and where he ultimately shot himself. It’s since been filled in and is now the most ordinary of dirt parking lots for adjacent buildings with just a small sign noting it’s significance in world history. It doesn’t look like anything special though and appears to have not prompted any of us to even take a picture.

Right near there is a very thought-provoking memorial, officially named the ‘Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe’. It’s a massive area (about the size of a block) with rows of different sized slabs of concrete that kind of resemble maybe the shape/size of a coffin, but not quite. The idea is that you walk through and experience the memorial, not just look at it as you walk by. And I must say I felt it quite worth the experience, as you walk in the ground sinks and the slabs get taller to the point they are quite a bit taller than you. You can always see your way out as there are no turns in the grid, but you still manage to feel almost lost and claustrophobic in the middle. As you make whatever optional turns you’d like it seems to just continue without end and you begin to think about what kind of isolated bad dream the jews reality was turned into.

The final stop was perhaps the most iconic Berlin landmark the Brandenburg gate, which was a very lovely square and gate. Interesting to note that when Napolean conquered the area he actually took the statue back with him to Paris, before eventually, the Germans took it back from him.

Now throughout this whole tour, there were also key landmarks of the division between what was known as West Berlin vs East Berlin. I had never actually realized that West Berlin was actually surrounded by the wall because it wasn’t connected with the rest of West Germany, but instead sat as an island of capitalism inside the communist East Berlin. The wall was literally established overnight, separating families and neighbors, and preventing any East Berliners from leaving to West Berlin where they could then flee to anywhere in the Western World.

We saw examples of what the checkpoints would have looked like between the two enemies at the iconic, if not overly staged “Checkpoint Charlie’, and remanents of the Berlin wall. We also were informed that ‘the wall’ was actually two walls with a ‘dead man’s zone’ (including land mines, trip wires, barbwire, guard towers instructed to shoot to kill, etc.) between the two walls. The wall surrounds West Berlin but is technically on the East Berlin side, as it doesn’t give West Berlin any jurisdiction to the wall. Any of the graffiti that you’ve seen iconically associated with the wall is definitely from the West Berlin side of the wall as getting that close to the wall in East Berlin would be the equivalent of a suicide mission.

After the tour, we went to another biergarten (really trying to embrace that German culture on day 1!) where we had an assortment of fairly typical German food (and beverages). We couldn’t linger too long though because we had to get over to Germany’s parliamentary building, the Reichstag, for which we had advanced reservations (required). The Reichstag resumed being Germany’s capital building following the reunification of East and West Germany. The part of the building you can observe as a visitor is a giant glass dome that sits on top of the structure looking down into the parliamentary chambers. The representation here is that the public should be keeping a constant watch on the government. (In general, there is no bashfulness in Germany recognizing the horrors that have taken place and the vigilance needed to ensure that it can never happen again). The dome itself was great and offered fantastic views of the city.

After our dome experience, we returned to the Memorial of the Murdered Jews of Europe where you can actually go beneath the memorial to a museum that does a very sobering and well documented showcasing of the atrocities. While I think we are all glad we did it, it was quite depressing to visit such a dark part of our human history.

As we exited the museum we were greeted by a pretty sunset over the memorial which helped lift our spirits and send us on our way to dinner. This was our first meal NOT at a Biergarten, though was still a fairly traditional German place. I had Pike fish, beer, and an apple strudel (all delicious), while Brian and Tyler both had …. some steak dish. (Don’t quite remember the name but they liked it). By the time we had finished our meal it was past 10PM and we decided we should call it a night and head back home to rest our legs. Tyler did make one more stop to buy a beer for the road and fully embraced this open container culture in Berlin!
