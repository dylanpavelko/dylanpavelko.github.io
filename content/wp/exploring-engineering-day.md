This weekend past weekend, the Engineering Student Council hosted Exploring Engineering Day (AKA Boy Scout Day) for the first time!

It was a tremendous success thanks to our Outreach Director, Erin Kimura, who organized the entire event.

I posted a couple of pictures taken by [Prentice](http://www.prenticew.com) (our superb resident photographer)
