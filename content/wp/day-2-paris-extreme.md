Bonjour! Day Un has now come and gone. And what a day it was! We were fortunate enough to not have any transportation nightmares, like we did yesterday, and we were able to run around and see SOO many amazing things.

The day started with taking the RER from Chessy in to Paris and going to our new hotel. Transportation was a breeze with Kaitlin leading the way! Comically, in Paris it is quite common for “street” performers to hop on different train carts and play music as the train goes and try and make a few euro. It was a bit awkward, but it definitely helped establish a foreign and unique quirky atmosphere for our new city.

Once we arrived at our hotel were lucky enough to be able to check-in to our room early, so we wouldn’t have to temporarily store our luggage. Our room was pretty small, but manageable and nice. And with a view of the Eiffel Tower! Ok…. really its just the very tip you can see…. not even worth a picture. But our view wasn’t bad either.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

After dropping off our luggage we were off to our first destination: Musee de Rodin!

This artist’s mansion, turn art museum, was full of impressive statue pieces, some nice paintings, and of course exquisite architecture and landscaping. Some of the most famous sculptures we saw there included *The Thinker*, *The Kiss*, and *Gates of Hell*. The place was huge, and art was just scattered everywhere! We decided to grab lunch their at this little shop thing. And ate outside in the shade (it was warm, but nice weather).<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

From the museum we went to our first major historical landmark—The Triumphal Arch!

It was quite large, and very impressive. The amount of detail in all the architecture and stone sculptures, in general in France, is quite impressive. The arch is encircled by a traffic round about. No lanes…. Just cars driving around constantly swirving around eachother. Thankfully there is an underground tunnel pedestrians are able to take too and from the Arch.

We then began our walk down Champ Ellyses (the main road that leads to the Louvre), stopping along the way to stop by random shops (we stopped in the what is surely the fanciest drug store on earth, and bough some macaroons!) Walking around it is funny to see American brands. I look at them and wonder if they appreciate them differently as ‘goods imported from America!’ Hopefully Lucky Charms and Cheese Whiz is helping our reputation?

The language barrier has been interesting for a few reasons. 1- Everyone you ask if they speak English they kind of grimae at your and shake their hand like … ‘I probably know as much as you know French’, but you then proceed to have a full conversation with them in English. And 2- It’s amazing how quickly you forget that most people won’t know what you are saying if you just start speaking English to them. I’ve been pretty good about it, but there have been a couple times where I’ll say something real quick without even thinking about the fact…they probably have no idea what I just said to them.

The walk down this main street was fairly long, and it was quite hot by the end. But it was amazing just to be in the hussle and bussle of all the Parisians…. or at least the other fellow tourists! We then stopped by Place de Concorde, where we were much more impressed with these fountains then the monolith in the center of the courtyard, we then strolled through the gardens in front of the Louvre, popped in a few more shops and then made our way to the Sine River. (We didn’t really spend too much time appreciating all of the Louvre’s awesomeness because that will be our main attraction for tomorrow).

What a pretty river, lined with tree’s, it is fairly crowded with a mix of tourist-trap vendors on the upper sidewalk, and what I assume to be locals chilling-out on the lower-level closer to the water sun tanning and/or drinking wine with friends. Ah, life as a Parisian must be a difficult one in deed.

What I at first thought was just one special bridge, and letter realized this occurred on many bridges crossing the Sines. There were all these bridges with locks chained to the fence. Symbolizing couple’s eternal love! The idea is a couple buys a lock and writes the date on it, locks it to the bridge and tosses the key in the river. Isn’t that romantic? Most locks on the bridge were only a couple months old …. Hate to be the anti-Cupid, but I’m pretty sure they have to regularly cut the locks off to keep it in control.

A little bit further down the river we crossed Pont Neuf to the island that Paris was founded on in, something like, 52 B.C. We were then suppose to see Sainte Chappelle and their amazing stain glass windows, but some man was only letting people in with tickets, and wouldn’t provide information where you could buy them saying it was too late. (it was 35 minutes before they closed). So that was a tad disappointing, but we quickly forgot about that when we walked over to Notre Dame de Paris where again we were able to marvel in architectural beauty, and then enter the cathedral (where they were about to conduct an actual mass). This turned out to be great timing, as we got to see the cathedral in action with live singers, priest, incense burning, etc. They also weren’t too shabby on the stain glass windows.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Now you may think clearly the day of seeing so many things is over, but no. There is still more!<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

[![](https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_2927.jpg?resize=420%2C280 "IMG_2927")](https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_2927.jpg)

After Notre Dame we headed back to Pont Neuf where we had booked a Sine River boat tour. It was quite enjoyable! If for nothing else to give us a chance to cool off, and rest our legs. It did give us some great and unique views of different major land marks along the Sine. I ended up taking a ridiciulous number of pictures of bridges during this cruise. My civil engineering friends would be proud!<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

After our boat tour we headed over to Saint Germaine for dinner (and for Laura to buy a new pair of shoes). It was a very quaint area, and was exactly how you imagine Europe to be. Random statues, strange drinking fountains, old fancy looking buildings, some narrow corridors with lots of outdoor seating restraunts, full of French people puffing out their cigarettes, and historical sites around every corner.

We ended up eating at a crepe place, followed by some gelato down the street.

We were going to go to the Eiffel Tower to view it closer at night time. But we all agreed to post-pone that to another day, and call it a night. All exhausted we piled back up to our hotel room, showered, and went to bed. Or atleast they did… I decided to write all this before I forget. So like a fool, I’m still up!

It was a long, amazing day, where it seemed literarily around every corner was another historical site you have grown up learning about. Paris is beautiful. In the distance you can kind of see some more modern looking buildings though, and it makes me wonder how intentional preserving the historical appearance of this city has been for its city politicians.

As I aforementioned, it was a long, tiring (totally worth it and amazing) day and I probably should get some sleep before we head to the Louvre tomorrow. So for now ….

Au revoir!
