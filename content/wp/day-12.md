Our day started with a trip to Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep. This is a temple on top of a mountain overlooking Chiang Mai that everyone had been telling us to go and see since we landed here in Chiang Mai. In addition to being considered the most beautiful temple in the area, it also is quite old and holds a lot of history.

To get there we had to flag down some type of transportation, we were going to try to find a red-truck as it seemed like a better idea than riding a tuk-tuk up the mountain for 30 minutes. But this one tuk-tuk driver kept on talking and seemed like he’d give us a good deal. He ended up driving us to his house, where he pulled out his own personal car and had us get in it to drive up the mountain. It was really nice, and a much more enjoyable ride in his air-conditioned car than in the back of either a tuk-tuk or red-truck. He was also very friendly and tried to talk with us some, though honestly I only probably understood about half of what he was telling us.

The road was windy, but not as bad as some of the other twisty adventures we’ve been on this trip. Sporadically along the road too there would be hikers, sometimes tourist looking, sometimes monks, going up to the temple. And then I assume in order to cater to all the hikers there were a number of vendors who had set up shop along the roadway as well. The mountain was lush with jungle plants, and quite steep. Legend has it that a white elephant carrying some important artifact died at the spot the temple is built, so that is why it is there. Personally I can’t imagine why an elephant would climb up this hill on its own accord.

Along this drive we again saw many pictures of the Thai King &amp; Queen. It is interesting to see where and how these portraits are placed. Since the Thai royals are required to be Buddhists there seems to be a lot of these pictures near the temples. It is also perhaps worth noting that the King of Thailand is the longest reigning monarch in the world, holding his position for 60+ years, longer than England’s Queen Elizabeth, and appears to be quite popular.

To get to the temple there is a staircase lined with these really cool snake statues. I had read that the stairs were quite brutal, and that the 310 steps would be challenging to climb. After all the other stairs we have climbed on this trip though, we found it quite moderate and easily found ourselves at the front of the temple.

Thai’s are able to visit the temple for free, but all foreigners must pay 30 baht, which is about 1 US dollar. Here there were a decent mix of Thai people, tourists, and monks all meandering about this beautiful temple. The temple is centered around a giant gold monument with many ornately designed buildings surrounding it and many Buddha statues.

We wandered this area without our shoes, as was requested, and took in all the beautiful sights. Once satisfied, we made our way back down the steps where our driver was waiting for us. He drove us back to our hotel where we had lunch, and then put our feet in the pool while we waited for it to be time to catch our plane to Bangkok.

Our plane ride over was quicker than expected, which was good because there was no leg-room on this flight! Literally, as in both of our knees were pressed up against the seats in front of us no-matter how we sat!

When the flight landed it was a similar experience to boarding in Hong Kong in that we weren’t actually at a terminal and had to walk down the stair-case and be shuttled to the actual airport. From there we easily found our bags and then a taxi.

Our taxi driver was really friendly, but we really couldn’t understand what he was saying despite him trying to tell us all sorts of things assumingly about the city. Bangkok reminds both of us a lot of LA. Only all the signs have Thai writing and there are lots of Buddha statues, and portraits of the King along the road. After about an hour drive we finally got to our hotel. Which was very fancy, but at the same time kind of peculiar. Strange service, and our room’s bathroom had glass walls! Uh, privacy?! There was a screen that could be lowered, that almost completely acted as a wall.

We then went and tried to get what was explained to us as a complimentary welcome drink at the bar, but after having troubles getting the elevator to go to the floor it was on, we asked the front desk who clarified that was only if we wanted to upgrade! That wasn’t very clear. They also didn’t have a room with two beds available as we had requested, in the entire hotel.

This large, fancy, American hotel really makes me realize I prefer small, local, homey hotels with great reviews. Despite having a really nice room, both of us are missing the friendly smiles from Chiang Mai.

We ended up getting on the Bangkok’s public rail system called BTS which was conveniently right by our hotel and went one stop over to check out one of the recommended places in this city, Siam Paragon. It is essentially a large mall, and we wandered around looking at a lot of familiar western brands.

Hungry, we went down the maze of escalators to the food court, where we tried to find something semi-cheap that was Thai. We found some noodle place that looked promising, but after getting our food we both thought the parts we wanted to be flavorful were bland, and the parts we wished didn’t have flavor there was too much of. We ate about half of it and then decided to grab something more familiar. Never would I think I would actually appreciate that our dear friend Ronald McDonald has gone around the world making sure Americans will never be hungry, but we ate some of the best French fries we’ve ever had.

After we did a little bit more shopping, we of course means Laura, we headed back to our hotel after making a quick run to the 7/11.

Bangkok is definitely interesting, and as mentioned before, really reminds me of LA. Big city buildings, people seem to know enough English to have our transactions go through, but in a less friendly (not hostile, just not friendly) way that also reminds me of being in LA.
