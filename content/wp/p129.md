*My Desk Space*

So this is a little bit late coming out, but better late then never! I promised I would give you an update on what my summer internship is like- so here it is!

I started working at [Arup](http://arup.com/) on June 21, 2010 as an Electrical Engineering Intern. Not knowing too much of what to expect I walked to work (its a 20-25 minute walk from 8th street to 2nd street) and talked to the security/reception who was able to wave me in to the elevator area where I went up to the 7th floor where Arup is located in the JP Morgan &amp; Chase Building. I was part of the last “wave of interns” to start along with three other people that day. In making small talk I found out they all went to schools similar to Cal Poly (Stanford, Berkley, and Cambridge… you know, its kinda the same!) and were all studying some variation of civil engineering in school.
