Not really getting any real sleep, before long my alarm was going off signaling it was 5AM, and the sun was about to rise. There are very few times that I will willingly wake up this early, but seeing the sun rise over the Great Wall of China certainly is one of them.

I woke up the others. Laura, Kaitlin, and I began to hike up the wall in the morning twilight to where we had seen the sun set the previous night. None of us got much, if any sleep, and you could tell as we all looked and acted rather sleep deprived. But once up to our summit, we were all awestruck again as we watched the sun rise. It was absolutely beautiful!

We then decided we should do some sunrise yoga, because why not? When else will we be able to do yoga as the sun rises on the Great Wall of China!

After the sun had fully risen, we once again climbed back down to our campsite for breakfast. There were just small silly things that we kept on finding funny, like when we’d had to go find a place to use the bathroom. We’d come back and be like (we just pee’d on the Great Wall of China!) Gross? Funny? Both!

After breakfast we packed up our stuff, and all quite tired from our lack of sleep hiked back down the trail to our van where we would all hopefully get a little more sleep than the night before on our ride.

Once in our van we set out to another section of the great wall that had been a little more well maintained, Mutianyu. The way there though was just as windy, and our driver certainly was focused on getting there fast. We all ended up border-line car sick, and quite ready to stand on our own two feet.

This section of the wall was much more well maintained, and a lot more designed for tourists. Interestingly this area is toured more often by Westerner’s because it is accessible, and has great views. Versus the section closer to Beijing which is also as touristy, has a little more history but is extremely crowded with Chinese tourists. This made it funny to hike around this area as it almsot looked like California with such a mix of different ethnicities.

We climbed around a few different sections of this wall, and got to see how the wall we slept on would have originally looked when it was constructed. The views were great, as was the wall. But compared to where we had camped the previous night I think we were all a little spoiled.

We hiked back down to the base, or rather Kaitlin and I did, Fiona and Laura took a toboggan/slide thing. Where we met up with our driver to took us to another large lunch. We got several dishes again and they were all quite delicious. Because our guide ordered everything I couldn’t really tell you the names of any of them, just that they were delicious, and not really like what we get in the USA for Chinese food.

All well fed, ‘fat &amp; happy’ we got back in our van to drive back in to the city center of Beijing. The roadway back was quite straight which we were all thankful for, and tried to nap as much as we could. Interestingly on our way we passed an area with some construction, I noticed there were several women working the traffic control positions. I remarked to Fiona that it was surprising to me because you practically never see any females working any construction job in the U.S.

Once back in Beijing we were dropped off at the Olympic Park Center where the Birds Nest Stadium, and Water Cube Aquatic Center are which housed the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It was pretty cool to see these buildings in person, after seeing them on TV, as well as in the halls of one of the companies I interned at (Arup) which did much of the engineering for their constrcution. The center was cool, but there really wasn’t too much to see or do, so we took some cheesey pictures (which we found the Chinese love to do) and continued on our way.

We all piled back in our van for the last time and headed to the airport. Very thankful to Fiona, who was a great tour guide, as well as our driver, we tipped them both and headed in to the airport a little early for our flight. It ended up being good we were early since we found out we were in the wrong terminal and needed to take a 20 minute shuttle to the correct one. Once there we tried to find some showers to freshen up since we were all pretty dirty from out intense hiking, and camping on the wall the past few days. Not finding anything really affordable, we settled with just freshening up in some restrooms.

I got hassled a little bit through security, and had to throw away my bug spray (even though I brought it with me the same way I was taking it out). After looking to see if there were any interesting souvenirs (we hadn’t really seen anywhere, where we had been), we didn’t find any that we liked or found unique. We still had quite a while before our plane began boarding though, so we decided to look through some of the spectacular photos we took over the past few days. This made the time fly by and before we knew it, it was time to go. We boarded on our plane and pretty much tried to just nap through as much of it as we could, we were all quite tired. (They also didn’t play our favorite song they played on the way there, sad).

We eventually landed and rushed to catch our shuttle bus back to our hotel which was about to leave. Luckily we caught it and tried to sleep on our ride back there as well. We didn’t get back to our place until about 1 AM, so we were all quite exhausted from a busy few days. When we got back to Kaitlins’ room we all just crashed, happy to be sleeping on a mattress, and even more happy with the amazing memories we now have.
