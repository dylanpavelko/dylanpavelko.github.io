With a slightly early start we were all off to catch the metro to an ‘Enjoy Rome’ Bus tour trip over to Tivoli to view Hardian’s Villa and Villa D’Este. We arrived at tour departure site and picked up our little radio headset pieces. Now instead of being annoyed by the tourists who stand in the middle of the path way with their headsets, we could be them!

After about a 40 minute bus ride to Tivoli, with a few extra historical facts thrown in about the journey, we arrived at Hardian’s Villa, Hardian was one of the emperor’s of Rome (considered to be one of the few who have the honor of being called a ‘great emperor of Rome’) and ruled primarily during a time of peace where Rome didn’t grow through conquest but focused on maintaining what they had. He was apparently a popular emperor who liked to tour, to make sure the people knew he was real and what he was doing to help. He also built his palace outside of Rome, in the hills of Tivoli (a city that according to legend was founded by Hercules). Hadrian built and lived in this enormous villa and palace in around the 2nd century of the common era (AD). However after years of neglect the palace fell in to ruin, and was re-popularized in the 16th and 17th centuries through tours, which led to excavations of the palace.

Our tour guide would point out graffiti marks occasionally, one that was initials with the year in the 1700’s, but it was at such a height that it made it very obvious how high the ground level was at the time, and how much of the palace had been excavated since then.

The villa was a odd blend of total ruins, copy’s of the original, and some restored pieces. Our guides warned us, similar to the forum, we would have to use our imaginations… and to fully appreciate this site you most certainly did. Through much of the villa our guide (Felix) would point out that all we were really seeing was the ‘skeleton’ and that on top of all the brick structures would have been painted and/or marble walls or mosaic floors. Occasionally you could see fragments of marble that was still intact, remnants of the buildings ‘skin’. Most of the building resources were taken, before archeology rose to the prominence it now has, to build Villa D’Este (ironically our afternoon destination) in the 16th century.

After walking around and seeing what was once a bath house, or library, or swimming pool, or palace, or … you get the idea I think we reached our peak appreciation amount for the site and started to focus more on our stomachs. The group boarded the buses again and we were taken more in to the center of Tivoli, where we were taken right to the tour entrance to Villa D’Este and given an hour to go find a lunch/explore. We ended up grabbing lunch at the place closest to the entrance, slightly pressured by the wait staff, and what a mistake! It was overpriced, and honestly not very good. Probably the first meal on this trip where I’ve felt pretty confident that I could do better.

After our mediocre lunch, we had a few minutes left before the second tour, and honestly were still hungry so we decided to fill up on our favorite food… gelato! (Once a day minimum was the doctors orders).

The group reformed and we began our tour of Villa D’Este, who built this Villa in the 16th Century. He was a cardinal and apparently was interested in becoming the pope, and partially built this Villa to impress people, as well as the current pope, into them thinking that this is the type of place a pope would live. Unlike Hardian’s Villa you did not have to use your imagination as hard to see the beauty of this villa. By far the main attraction was a series of fountains throughout the gardens of the Villa that were just phenomenal and beautiful. There were a lot of stairs involved in this tour (stairs built for horses, so they were much longer than normal) which resulted in lots of walking and climbing around, but it was all worth it because it was so pretty.

We were lucky as it was also pretty fair weather. It was warm, but not terribly hot, and remarkably it was not too humid in Tivoli. We all commented that it felt kind of like sunny California weather. (We really are spoiled) In the afternoon it typically rains in Tivoli, and while it did begin to cloud up, not before we got our pictures with plenty of blue sky. As we toured Villa D’Este our guide was showing us how when they were repairing part of the building they discovered that it was actually built on top of an older building. Similar to the roman forums, and Hadrian’s Villa there are many layers of history throughout Italy, or as the guide says “Italy is like lasagna, it has lots of layers”.

After making the rounds at Villa D’Este we bored the bus again for our trip back home (back to Termini Station) where we took a short ride over back to the Spanish Steps area where some shopping was to be done. (I didn’t buy anything, but let’s just say some members of our group are helping the Italian economy out).

Brian and I ended up walking around, looking for food, which was surprisingly difficult to find considering almost every where else we’ve been there has been an abundance of ‘hole in the wall food shops’. I eventually got a piece of pizza and then we all met up on the Spanish Steps and waited a bit for our dinner reservation time at a place we saw the previous day, but weren’t able to eat at.

We had a delicious dinner, I had spaghetti amatriciana which was delicious (especially however they cooked their bacon, yum!) and everyone else had a bunch of food as well (sorry, can’t remember) but we were all pretty full finally after a long day of exploring. We then took the metro back to the apartment and called in a night. Jet lag, the amount of walking we did today, or just the accumulation of several days of being on-the-go is certainly catching up with me as I feel the most tired tonight. Luckily we don’t have to get up quite as early tomorrow as we will be going just a few blocks from our apartment to a whole different country… the Vatican City!
