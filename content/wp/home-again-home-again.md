After nearly 24 hours of travel, where in my attempt to beat jet-lag, I stayed awake nearly the entire time– I am back home!

It is strange to be back, almost as if the past 9 days have all been just a dream. I am quite thankful that I took the time to write all of these blogs along the way, to help remind myself that it was not a dream, I was there, it’s all real.

As I start to drift back in to the daily ordeals of life, my mind continues to go back to Europe and reflect on the different cultures of the two cities: Paris’s laid back and very foreign feel, and Londons more familiar yet delightful and friendly conversationalist attitude. Both rich with so much history and beauty.

Big thanks to Kaitlin, and especially Laura for travelling along and making the trip so enjoyable (and taking pictures of me too)!

And thank you, brave reader, for reading through this storm of blogs. They ended up quite longer then I expected, hopefully you felt like you were right along side us on our journey!

Sincerely,  
Dylan
