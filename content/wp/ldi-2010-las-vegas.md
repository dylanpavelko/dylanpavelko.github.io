This past weekend I had the awesome experience of attending [LDI](http://www.ldishow.com/LDI11/public/enter.aspx), which is a huge entertainment lighting trade show that occurs once a year in the United States.

My attendance at this event is an unusual story as well, so I thought between going to it and how I ended up going, it was definitely worth a blog post! Plus I haven’t done one for a while.

About three weeks ago I started a little-bit of outreach in terms of figuring out what I wanted to do my senior project on. I emailed a student at poly that my roommate knew, who has the most experience in lighting out of any other student at Cal Poly (at least that she/I know of) to see if he’d be willing to bounce project idea’s around. I also emailed a few people that I found online at a company called [Electronic Theatre Controls](http://www.etcconnect.com/) (ETC) about a specific project idea that uses ACN. All of the emails were a shot in the dark, with little to no expectations of a response.

To make a long post short(er). I exchanged some email with the CP student and we set up a meeting time, then I got a phone call from ETC from a cal poly alumni who asked 1: How we didn’t know eachother? and 2: what I was doing in 2 weeks? And if I wanted to go to LDi in Las Vegas?

As fate would have it the student I had been corresponding with was also invited by this guy, along with two other guys from SLO, and two weeks later I hopped in a car with three strangers and went to Vegas! (I think I disappointed them all with how boring I am)

Seeing Vegas for the first time was cool in itself but the actual convention was even cooler- as tech-nerdy as that may be! Every single kind of light you could imagine was on the floor, as well as LED video walls, this cool water-screen-fountain thing, lasers, consoles, and everything else that could relate to lighting (a fair amount of rigging companies).

Talking to different companies on the floor about what their products were, and how they are different and innovative was really educational! (however I’m not sure that it helped me narrow down senior project ideas down… other than finding out a lot has already been done :P)

What undoubtedly was the icing on the cake of the entire experience though, was an ETC hosted student party. Where the company that invited me, had a party for their interns and scholarship winners (and we were fortunate enough to be able to attend as well… thanks Lowell!) where the students were encouraged to mix and mingle with the giants of the industry. Talking to the engineers who are currently pioneering the technology I want my senior project to be centered around was so valuable, as well as …talking to the CEO and VP of R&amp;D of ETC (a company that is very much on my radar or places I would LOVE to work) … it was awesome! =)

All in all it was an invaluable experience, thats got me totally motivated for my senior project… just have to finalize an idea now! Thanks to everyone who made the experience possible &amp; memorable!
