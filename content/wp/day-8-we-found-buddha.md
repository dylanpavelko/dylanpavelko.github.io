<span style="text-align: left;">Our last full-day in Hong Kong, we finally took advantage of sleeping in, and it felt great! Well rested, we headed out to see ‘Big Buddha’ on Lantau Island. It was almost the exact same route we took to get to Disneyland the previous day, so we got there without incident.</span>

Once there we got in a queue to take a gondola ride up to Po Lin Monastery where Big Buddha sits. The gondola ride was nice and provided us with some spectacular views. Laura though prior to the trip claimed being on an elevator going up 118 floors would be much more traumatic than a gondola ride, had a change of opinion once we were hanging by a wire, swinging in the breeze hundreds of feet above the ground. She stayed calm though, and it was an enjoyable ride. After the approximately 30 minute ride, we reached the top, and had entered the clouds. It was kind of neat to be so high, that it felt like you were walking around in the sky.

As we walked past some of the tourist souvenir shops, and through this path-way of 12 generals (which were these cool statues) we saw all these, seemingly feral, dogs running around. They were all friendly enough not to be barking, but not so socialized (or maybe it was a cleanliness factor) that everyone was rushing to pet them.

The Big Buddha (officially called Tian Tan Buddha) was pretty impressive. It is the largest sitting Buddha in Hong Kong, and is quite a destination point for many. The statue is made of bronze and was constructed in 1993. We hiked the steps (which seemed so easy compared to those on the Great Wall), and soon were up in the clouds with Buddha! It was quite a relaxing spot to be, as the clouds swirled around us, we did a walking meditation around Buddha.

We then hiked back down the stairs to go get lunch at the monastery, which serves a vegetarian lunch menu. It was pretty tasty too!

Interestingly, we didn’t really see many Buddhist monks around this area, either as tourists or ones living at the monastery. Mostly just tourists.

After getting our fill of the area, and after Laura discovered some very decadent ice cream flavors to sample, we caught a bus down to the fishing village of Tai O. This village, built on stilts over the water is supposed to be more similar to what Hong Kong historically looked like prior to being westernized by the British. Spotted fishing communities among the islands. The area was pretty, and reminded us of Morro Bay back at home. With narrow shop-lined walkways we wandered the ‘streets’ of Tai O, until we had enough of all the dried smells.

We hopped on a bus that took us back to the MTR station, and for the last time rode back to what we’ve called ‘home’ for the past week.

We got home about the same time Kaitlin got back from work, and we all went together to get Hot Pot for dinner at a restaurant attached to the hotel. The food was pretty good, however we definitely struggled through some language barrier issues. Though it was difficult at times, it was nice that they were certainly trying their best to serve us… even when Laura tried to clarify our order using her usual vernacular of extremely complicated word choices! Luckily Kaitlin was standing by ready to translate ‘Laura’s English’ into ‘Hand Gesture-Accompanied Basic English’ for the waiters. The staffs attentiveness and best attempts we all agreed would not be the case in America, with our ‘you are in America now, learn our language!’ attitude.

Tomorrow Laura and I will be packing our bags again, and headed over to Thailand for the remainder of our adventure!
