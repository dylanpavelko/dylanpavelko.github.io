Our second day in Paris was full of art, and once again lots of walking!

We headed over to the Louvre pretty much as soon as it opened. We were able to go straight to the ticket line (skipping the entrance line), since we took the metro which was nice.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Now, I had of course heard that the Louvre is gigantic, and that they have everything and everything you can imagine. But those statements are no match for the pure grander of the Louvre! We entered on the ancient art side, and were immediately taken back to ancient Egypt and Greece! (After walking past some of the historic underground ruins of the original castle structure of the Louvre). The Greek classical statues were unbelievably detailed. And to think they have survived millenniums relatively undamaged (ok so there were some missing heads, arms, and for a few unfortunate male statues some important anatomical parts!). The greek art mostly featured gods or legendary stories and were almost all nudes of different people. With the idea being that humans and the Gods resembled each other (apparently to give hope to us mortals).<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Moving on to ancient Egyptian art, and relics, I was really impressed the shear number of pieces they were able to gather for their exhibits. Room, after room, after room of statues, stone-walls with carved hieroglyphics, vases, tools. Truly remarkable that it was all able to be so well preserved and transported to Paris.

One of the crazy parts about the Louvre is that you would glance out the window, or walk in to a new room, and be impressed by all the ornate architecture of the palace—and be reminded that royals used to walk these halls. Using some of my deductive analytical skills, I have decided the reason kings are always flashing their muscled calves in their [official portraits](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Louis_le_Grand%3B_Harnas.jpg/220px-Louis_le_Grand%3B_Harnas.jpg), is because they had to roam these halls and go up 6 flight of stairs (maybe more) just to get from the bottom to the top.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

After Egypt we visited ‘The Great Hall’ which is filled of Renaissance &amp; Christian Art. Lots of Baby Jesus, and Crucifixions paintings. This was a huge jump in artistic style as everything started becoming much more realistic. It was here we got to marvel in several of the works of Leonardo DaVinci, including the prized possession of the Louvre, the Mona Lisa! Perhaps because everyone had warned me the painting was really small, I actually was pleased with how big it turned out to be. None of my photos really capture its size well… but it’s a nice sized portrait. It’s just dwarfed by a painting opposite of it that literally covers the entire wall!<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

We then began exploring some more French Artists work, which while artistically quite impressive, they were often rather depressing, the artists did wonders capturing the emotions of their subjects, and reflecting what I assume was the spirit of the times.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

[![](https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3304.jpg?resize=420%2C280 "IMG_3304")](https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3304.jpg)

The largest painting in the Louvre is of Napolean’s coronation. So big the people in the painting were life size (or possibly larger than life), it’s was also really hard to capture the entire painting in a picture.

The incredible paintings go on and on, as they say, you can’t see the entire Louvre in a day. And we certainly didn’t (though we did see much of it). I’ll skip ahead a little bit to spare you all the details of the paintings.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

[![](https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3369.jpg?resize=420%2C280 "IMG_3369")](https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3369.jpg)

Eventually we decided to change areas and go view Napolean’s Apartment area. Now when I say apartment this may lead you to think… small, couple rooms, modest. This of course was anything but! Every room was ornately decorated, from the carvings on the doors, and walls, to the many chandeliers that hung in every room. These rooms were clearly designed to impress, and be enjoyed by nobility. Especially walking through these rooms, the historical location really became apparent. That these people you read about in textbooks…. lived here, ate here. walk down these very same halls. Just incredible.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Eventually we made our way out of the Louvre, and on to our next destination– The Mussee de l’Orangerie. This museum is most famous for being the home to Monet’s famous water lilly paintings, which were actually created with the intention of them being installed in this specific venue. It shows, the way these massive canvases curved around the two circular rooms just made for an incredibly peaceful atmosphere. It was also nice and air-conditioned and we took the opportunity to rest and relax sitting in a room surround by Monet paintings. Is this real life?

The museum also featured some works from 7 or so other famous artists, who I was less familiar with (except Picasso, which was …. well, awesome of course!). The art in this museum was dramatically different then the very realistic paintings we had been surveying all day at the Louvre and it was neat to see the style change. It was as if we we spent the day walking down a timeline of art. I can only imagine how much more I would have got out of this day if I had a stronger art history background, if I was so thoroughly impressed with the little knowledge I did have (combined with Laura and Kaitlin chiming in their knowledge).

One interesting observation I noticed as a common trend amongst all the art I saw from ancient Egypt to the past century. We as a human race have an incredible interest in ourselves. I would venture a guess to say, as much of 90% of the art, featured the human form. I find it interesting to think about what that says about us as a species, and then also observe how the way we depict ourselves (fellow humans) changed over the centuries.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

By this time in the day most museums had closed up shop, so we headed over to Montmarte, which is known as the ‘Art District’ of Paris. (More where the artists live, than where a wealth of their work is on display.) Here we climbed the steps to see Sacre Coeur and its views of the Paris skyline. Perhaps I am already getting jaded, they were nice, but not necessarily my favorites (the landmark or the views). Don’t get me wrong, beautiful, just not my favorite. The area around the Sacre Coeur was also quite crowded with what were sure to be fellow tourists, both walking up the stairs, and resting/eating on the lawns. There were also an excess of street vendors in the area which were a bit more in your face then other places.

We then walked around Sacre Coeur and found a nice little place to have dinner. Appetizer + Dinner + Desert = 14 Euro…. Not bad. The food was also delicious. Laura and I both ordered the Beef Bourginion which was tasty, while Kaitlin got somet kind of vegetarian dish that had a unique kind of cheese, and then we all shared a merlot. Without doubt the most interesting food eaten at the table was escargot– which Laura ordered as an appetizer, and I did in-fact try one! (Snail is now tops the list as the strangest food I’ve ever eaten). I don’t know that I would ever order it again, but it wasn’t *that* bad. Very buttery and garlicy, which tasted good, just had a strange kind of texture that wasn’t right up my alley.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

After walking around Sacre Coeur a bit more and popping in to some tourist shops, we decided to head back down the hill and get a photo-op in front the famous Moulin Rouge! It looks kind of pretty in pictures, but really not quite the same as history, and movies depict it as. The entire walk there, the streets are lined with different kind of sex shops, from naked shows, to “erotic art” museums, to strip clubs. It kind of shined a light on the fact that, that this is the Moulin Rouge’s origins as well. What was also peculiar about this area was that the majority of the signs were in English. Clearly targeting tourists. We took our photos, glad we got to see it in person, and then rather quickly left the area.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Some general observations I have been making since being here is how France makes little effort to accommodate the non-fit Parisian or tourist. Many area’s are a tight squeeze, even for us skinny people. And I begin to see how other countries can begin to build the reputation that America has a majority of rather over-weight people. Because Paris doesn’t, one wouldn’t really be able to get around easily. Speaking of not being able to get around easy. Time and again I was encountering areas that seemed to be only accessible via stairs.

It made me curious what kind of Disability Access laws they have, because in America that seems to be a prominent component to the accessibility of essentially anywhere. (And rightly so). Specifically travelling in the underground metro, which is a maze of tunnels connecting different routes, with several sections of stairs you might have to go up and down 2 or 3 just to get to your connection train. How a person in a wheel chair would navigate around here is beyond me.

My final cultural difference that is rather obvious here as an American, is the difference in attitudes towards PDA (public displays of affection). Perhaps we are just a bunch of prudes in America. But where we might find it odd to see people kiss on the lips in the states. It’s really not unusual to walk by a full on make-out session taking place … well anywhere. Not that there is anything wrong with it necessarily, it just is noticeably more common and acceptable here.

All in all, a spectacular day where incredible doesn’t even do it justice.

It is now late… or rather early in the morning here, so I am going to end it here. Tomorrow our main attraction will be heading to the capital of Champagne, Reims. Where we will be doing a little beverage sampling! =)

Au revoir!
