I thought I’d share a few web technologies that I’ve been playing around with recently as well as some that I am hoping to learn more about.

As the <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" data-gr-id="3" id="3">back-bone</g> of a lot of hobby-projects I’ve been working on recently has been [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://rubyonrails.org/images/rails-logo.svg)</figure>I’ve had no formal training with Rails, or Ruby (ROR, Rails) for that matter, but have found the framework to be relatively easy to learn. There is also a sizable community that uses it so there are a lot of online resources to help troubleshoot many of the problems you may run in to.

I did a variation of this free online class [Rails for Zombies](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/code-school-rails-for-zombies). Which covered the basics of how to interact with Rails and introduced me to the concept of Model-View-Controller web architecture.

The real benefit of Rails for me is that I don’t have a lot of knowledge of managing a database, and Rails very easily takes care of all the dirty work. This allowed me to focus on building my application in a much richer and faster way than I could before.

Now that I could build out a more impressive application I realized that I’m also not so great at styling with my own CSS. To compensate for this I’ve started making use of a popular styling framework called [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/www.drupal.org/files/project-images/bootstrap-stack.png?w=525&ssl=1)</figure>Once you discover it, you also discover it feels like half the internet is styled with ‘vanilla’ bootstrap styling. If you are trying to look unique that may not be a ‘positive’, but if you are just trying to look polished it is very easy to learn, again free and can give your site a dramatic make-over.

#### What’s Next?

Now that I can make data persist, and look half-decent the aspect of my applications/sites that I’m not content with is the interaction layer. Lot’s of clicks, page loads, fields to fill out. It’s either kind of clunky or a lot of work and troubleshooting for me to stitch together some page experiences that are a little more intuitive to use. To help improve that I’m going to explore using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9Ii0xMS41IC0xMC4yMzE3NCAyMyAyMC40NjM0OCI+CiAgPHRpdGxlPlJlYWN0IExvZ288L3RpdGxlPgogIDxjaXJjbGUgY3g9IjAiIGN5PSIwIiByPSIyLjA1IiBmaWxsPSIjNjFkYWZiIi8+CiAgPGcgc3Ryb2tlPSIjNjFkYWZiIiBzdHJva2Utd2lkdGg9IjEiIGZpbGw9Im5vbmUiPgogICAgPGVsbGlwc2Ugcng9IjExIiByeT0iNC4yIi8+CiAgICA8ZWxsaXBzZSByeD0iMTEiIHJ5PSI0LjIiIHRyYW5zZm9ybT0icm90YXRlKDYwKSIvPgogICAgPGVsbGlwc2Ugcng9IjExIiByeT0iNC4yIiB0cmFuc2Zvcm09InJvdGF0ZSgxMjApIi8+CiAgPC9nPgo8L3N2Zz4K)</figure></div>React is a “javascript library for building user interfaces.” And apparently is used on a lot of very notable sites. I’m very curious to learn how it will play with ROR, if it will require me to re-write many of my UI’s or if it is a layer that sits on-top/inside of my existing code.

Wish me luck!
