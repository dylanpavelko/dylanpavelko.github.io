After a quick stop by a grocery store, we started our day by taking the train in to the city center, Marienpatz. There we saw the famous glockenspiel, and then proceeded to get slightly lost while trying to find the starting point for our bike tour of Munich. Eventually we did find the meeting point, and just at the right time when they were about to start the introductions.

The bike tour was awesome, the guys were funny, the terrain was mostly flat, and the bike ride included lunch in a beer garden! It did make it a little awkward to figure out how to take pictures as we were pedaling around the streets of Munich, but I managed to snap a few. One of the recurring interesting facts I found was that much of the city was destroyed during the bombings of WWII, but Munich has rebuilt almost the entire city to look like it once did. That said because that is expensive, many of the exteriors of the buildings have painted facades to indicate what the structure originally may have looked like, while they slowly rebuild the replica facades as resources allow.

We whizzed around on our bikes through cobblestone streets, through palace court yards, past churches and statues â€¦. honestly itâ€™s all a little bit of a blur of good memories and laughs. The guide was pretty entertaining. We then pedaled our way in to the English Gardens and had lunch at the Beer Garden under the Chinese Tower, where they were playing Bavarian music, and selling Bavarian food. (Yes, the guide made the joke that we were in Germany, at the English Gardens, eating at the Chinese tower). I had a Pretzel, a sausage, and a giant beer. (Those are the three food groups in Germany it seems) It was all delicious, I got fairly tipsy. ðŸ™‚

We pedaled around some more in the garden, a little intoxicated, and then after a few more stops (including these river surfers) our time was up and we were returning back to the meeting point.

From there we went and checked out some shops. Prentice and Brian O bought some fancy lederhosens, while I opted to just buy a shirt. We then split up in to two groups, and Jessica and Jenn went to look for Drindleâ€™s while Brian O, Prentice, and myself went back to the hotel to drop off stuff.

After a quick turn around we all met up again to explore the main attraction, Oktoberfest!

Itâ€™s HUGE! I was expecting like a big fair-grounds kind of area with a bunch of tents set up and beer being served. Itâ€™s kind of like that but like three times the size I was expecting, the tents are two story structures that look permanent (but apparently arenâ€™t), and there are a ton of rides. It felt like a State Fair tripled in size, and replace all the agricultural aspects with more beer drinking. Pretty crazy.

There were also pretty large crowds, and for a while Brian O got separated and it was surprisingly difficult to reconnect. Having limited data and battery power on our devices, and signs all in other languages proved for a patience trying many minutes on all parts Iâ€™m sure.

We finally met up and grabbed some food, and wandered around a bit more. No drinking tonight, as we have a reservation at a tent tomorrow. It was pretty funny though to see everyoneâ€¦ everyone just stumbles around the place drunk. But for that type of an event it was all in good fun. We were all commenting on how an event like this wouldnâ€™t turn out the way it does here in MÃ¼nchen if it were back in the States.

We took the train back, all with tired legs from a day of walking and biking, and ready for a good nights rest and a late start tomorrow!
