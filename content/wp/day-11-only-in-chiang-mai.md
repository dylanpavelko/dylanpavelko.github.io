A new day has risen, and so have we, early and excited for our day, which would include visiting an elephant park! We went to our hotels restaurant again for breakfast and grabbed something quick and yummy and then shortly there after was picked up by a shuttle to take us to the elephants!

After picking up a few others in nearby hotels, we were off for about an hour ride outside of Chiang Mai’s old city (where we were all staying) to the elephant park. The drive provided us the opportunity to see more of the Thailand scenery. From different shops, several large pictures or monuments to the Thai King, and some wilderness.

When we arrived at Baan Chang Park (Baan translates to home, Chang to Elephant) we were provided with a change of clothes. This was partly because elephants are dirty and we wouldn’t have to worry about getting our clothes dirty. But I suspect it was also to help not startle the elephants if all of guests always where the same type of clothes each day. They were some very flattering one size fits all denim type material.

The park is actually an elephant rescue sanctuary where they have 27 elephants, most of which have been rescued from environments that aren’t very nice for the elephants. A lot of places still use elephants for manual labor, paint the elephants to help beg for money, or put carts on to give rides to tourists. All of that is considered not very humane, and Baan Chang Park tries to provide a more natural environment where they try to keep the elephants as happy as possible.

The first thing we got to do with these magnificent creatures is go up and feed them. We had several large baskets of banana bunches and sugar canes, were shown how to feed the elephants, and pretty much let loose. (There were mahouts, elephant trainers, there with each elephant as well). You would essentially take an entire bunch of bananas and walk up to an elephant and hand it to their trunk (which was often reaching out to you, ready for food), or you could drop the food directly in their mouths. They would then eat the entire bunch of banana’s (skin &amp; all) and be ready for more. Elephants eat a lot! You could also go up and pet the elephants as well, they especially like being rubbed on their trunk where you could imagine their nose to be. I found them to be a lot more rough and scratchey than I was expecting, with think bristley hair. Their skin is also 2-3 inches thick!

I was also surprised with the dexterity of their trunks, being both quite nimble, and strong they could easily hold on to one bundle of food while they fed more food in their mouth or life something quite heavy.

Once we had gone through many baskets of food it was time for our own mahout lesson, where they taught us some basic instructions for elephants, and how to get on an elephant, make it go forward, stop, and turn. It was really exciting to see the elephants kneel and let you climb up on him, and then walk around. All of the commands we were saying though didn’t feel like the elephant was listening to us, at all, and really would just listen to their regular mahouts on when to lay down, turn, stop, etc. It was really quite remarkable though to have these gentle giants seemingly follow our wishes.

The mahouts are really interesting, and have a really unique relationship with the elephants and each other. They seem to constantly be teasing each other (both humans and elephants) and would often just burst out singing a random line to a song.

After our lesson it was time for OUR lunch, luckily it was more than banana’s and sugar cane for us. They had some soup, fried chicken, and stir fry for us. It was all pretty good, and afterwards we were advised by our guide to lounge around in these bamboo hammocks as later we would be helping the elephants exercise by taking the elephants on walk, riding them bareback. Giving us plenty of time to digest our food, we got to know our fellow tourists a little which was neat. 2 from Quebec, 2 from Seattle (but are also actually Canadian), and one from Alaska. All fairly close in age, which is neat to see and kind of compare what everyone is doing, and how they are finding the time and money to get here from North America.

Once our food was all nice and settled, we all got our own elephant to get-up on and ride around the park in this large loop. It was fun, exciting, and sometimes a little scary. For the most part they would just follow either the elephant in front of them or a mahout. However sometimes my elephant would want a drink of water, or to grab a bush to start eating, and once we almost walked off a cliff. Luckily the mahouts were attentive and got him back on course.

It was funny, as we would walk when the elephants would get hot, they would spray themselves, as well as us with water that they had sucked up previously. It was surprisingly cool, and both refreshing, as well as dirty and gross!

By the end of our second, and final lap, all of our legs were a little sore from the weird way that you ride an elephant, and it was nice to stand with our own two feet on the ground again.

We then got to bathe the elephants, as they all walked in to this pond thing, we followed suit, in our stylish provided outfits, splashed them down, and scrubbed them with these brushes. The mahouts were in there with us, and I’m not sure how it started, but I think it was them… it definitely turned in to a water fight for a while.

My elephant was super chill, and just kind of lay in the water the entire time which shielded me a bit from all the water flying around.

After bathing them, we then said good-bye to these amazing creatures. I honestly don’t feel like any of us really connected with our elephants that much, they were more amusing us (or rather their trainers), but it was still an incredible experience to be so close and interactive with such a large and majestic animal.

We then showered off for ourselves, and got back in to our own clothes, ready to be driven back to the real world. The drive went quicker than we anticipated, which worked out perfectly as we got to go to an activity I didn’t know if we’d have time to make!

At one of the temples, Wat Suan Dok, two nights a week they have something called ‘Monk Chat’, where they provide the opportunity for some monks who are studying at the temple to meet with English-speaking tourists and have a conversation about life in the temple, Buddhism, or anything else you want to talk about. For them it is a chance to practice their English, for us a chance to learn about their culture. It was all organized by this English guy (not a monk), who has lived in Thailand for 18 years now, and was quite a character himself.

I think we both found it really interesting, especially all of the rules that they have to follow as Buddhist monks. Some of them seem quite strict, and others they seem to frequently break and just have to admit to it to their teachers. It was interesting too to hear them talk about things they want (though if what they want doesn’t happen, they don’t cling to it, they try to live in the present), and how even as monks they still have some attachments (like to their parents) because they are human still after all.

It also sounded like a common way people begin being a monk, is as a young child born in to poverty, it can provide a better life where they may not have to work so hard (at least manually). That said everything isn’t provided for the monks, and they often talked about how they would need to have enough money to pay for their education. All the monks we talked to were currently in a Buddhist University getting their Bachelors in Buddhism/Humanities. (They could have the certificate say either, depending on where they planned on ending up.) One of the monks we talked with was originally from Bangladesh, which is now a primarily Islamic country, so having a Bachelor in Humanities would be preferable he said. Funny enough to be worth noting, this monk looked EXACTLY like a young Barack Obama. Like identical, same big ears, same mole, I asked him if he had seen a picture of the United States President before and he laughed and shook his head saying everyone at his school calls him Obama! I was too shy to ask for a picture after that, unfortunately.

We then walked down the street looking for some sort of transport to a recommended restaurant. After waiting at a cross walk for several minutes we decided despite pressing the button it was never going to stop the traffic, and we assertively (though quite frightened) walked across the street in order to easier catch a tuk-tuk. Instead we found another open taxi-truck, which pulled over, even though it already had people in it and took us to the place we saw recommended for dinner.

Dinner was pretty good, we got Thai Tea’s, Kao Soi (which was good but left both of our mouths on fire), some noodle dish, and then mango on sticky rice, and Thai-tea ice cream. The restaurant was small and random, but I thought quite tastey!

Too early to call it a night, we decided to grab a tuk-tuk and go to the night bazar again to walk around, especially since it wasn’t raining this night! It was definitely more enjoyable without having to huddle under the plastic tarps, and we found a few more things that we thought were worth picking up (even if my bartering skills aren’t all that great).

We then headed home for our last night in Chiang Mai, and relaxed a little more on our porch drinking Chang beer (which we learned at the Baan Chang Park is jokingly said to be made from elephant pee, recall Chang translates to elephant). We hope to get one more sight seen before we head out of Chiang Mai to Bangkok tomorrow, but have greatly enjoyed our time in this relaxing city, with friendly people.
