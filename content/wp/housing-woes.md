Well, I drove up today to Sunnyvale, CA. To prepare to move in to my apartment in San Francisco…. oh wait! I don’t have one yet! Uh oh! Yes, I start work on Monday…. and still don’t have a place to stay in the city yet.

My grandparents are graciously letting me crash at their place while I look, but I am getting awfully nervous. Everything is so expensive, or wants a year lease, or etc.

I have been looking pretty consistently since I found out I would be working in SF, and am just shocked that I still haven’t found anything that matches up with me.

Meanwhile, my online classes through Hancock started Monday, and I already have an online sociology quiz due by 5PM tomorrow! Ugh, where is my summer!

I suppose I will be updating my blog more frequently, with less important updates likes these, merely because my to-do list is limited when I am living out of my suitcase.

Wish me luck…
