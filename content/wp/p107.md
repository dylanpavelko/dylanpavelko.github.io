A couple weeks ago, I began mourning the loss of my 1.5TB Seagate External Hard Drive. Not only the loss of the device, but the loss of hundreds of files that were stored on their, and no place else. Now contemplating whether I think its worth it to shell out some serious doe, I have spent a little bit of time researching what I think the best data back up protection plan there is for a moderately heavy-computer user.

I thought since I was doing all this research why not post what I found to work well, so others can hopefully not have the same data problems that I did.

**What I use:** (as of 7/10/2010)  
1 MacBook Pro <span style="color: #3366ff;">\[111.4GB/120 GB\]</span>  
1 Lenovo T400 <span style="color: #3366ff;">\[27.7GB/150 GB\]</span>  
1 External Hard Drive (Storage for pictures, old files, etc.) <span style="color: #3366ff;">\[1TB, currently\]</span>

The most important lesson learned (and it had been told to me before, but I didn’t take it as seriously) is that you NEVER want to only have ONE COPY of anything. If you put a file on your back-up hard drive, and then delete it from your computer. If your hard drive dies, it is GONE FOREVER! The second thing that I learned is that even if you have two hard drives mirrored to eachother if htey are in teh same equipment box (or a RAID hard drive set up) if something happens to that box (drop it, spill a drink on it, etc.) your going to lose. And the extreme case, that I hadn’t put too much thought in before: even if you have two seperate hard drives with the same files in the same location, you still have a good chance of losing it all. (Think disaster status, your back up hard drive and lap top are in your car when you crash it, there is a fire in your room, etc.) You can buy a new computer or hard drive, but most people now have years of data information that can’t just be “bought back”. This has led me to the conclusion that I want to have all of my information backed up someplace I’m not!

I currently just bought a 1TB Western Digital External Hard Drive and partitioned it in 1/2 (1/2 to back up my Mac, and 1/2 for file storage). I would now like to back this information, as well as my PC laptop information on a hard drive that I keep in my old room at my mom’s house. This will probably be easiest done though a network server. I found this really useful video online about how to set one up using FreeNAS.
