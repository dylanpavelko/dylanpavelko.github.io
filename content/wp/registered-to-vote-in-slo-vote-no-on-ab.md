Are you registered to vote in the City of San Luis Obispo? If so, I encourage you to vote NO on the special election Measure’s A &amp; B.

While they seem good intentioned, and are attempting to manage the cities budget. I don’t feel like giving more power and control to the 5 city council members currently in office is the alternative we are looking for.

Measure A is an attempt to speed up bargaining discussions, and allow the city council to reduce the compensation distributed to public servants without first seeking voter consent. Frankly, I think the citizens of San Luis Obispo should be able to have a say in that decision. If we are content with the current pay rates for firefighters and policeman, because we think it attracts better candidates, we should be able to make that decision. Having an election for such a decision seems worthwhile, and likely could be scheduled in to a pre-scheduled election (unlike this unscheduled special election which technically won’t change anything about SLO just how we can make changes). For these reasons I am voting NO on Measure A.

Measure B also seems like a situation where the city council members are attempting to give themselves more power. Essentially the current situation is if two sides can’t agree after negotiations, they talk to a middle man who considers both points of views and comes up with a fair solution. Measure B is trying to take out that middle man and force the agreement to be the best offer of the governing body (the city council). Immediately this seems counter intuitive to me, the city council members attempt to reason their decision making by stating arbitrators are not member of our community, and won’t understand us. However I feel like having an outsider when the two inside parties can not agree is likely the best solution.

The main point I found in the rebuttal against the argument to Measures A and B, is that they believe city workers are being paid too much compared to inflation, and other measurements (including average citizens financial situations).

In short, I don’t think any of this would be a concern if the city was balancing its budget, and I don’t think we should be looking at civil servants salaries and pensions as the place to save money. And if we DO, I think it should be a decision we make as a community, or with the help of a third party. Not letting the 5 members of the city council have the final say in these matters.

Disagree with me? That is awesome! Tell me why please, I’m genuinely interested in what you think either invalidates or trumps the points I’ve mentioned above. =)

Most importantly, VOTE, if you are registered in SLO City!
