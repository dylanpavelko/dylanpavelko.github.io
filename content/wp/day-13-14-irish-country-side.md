**Day 13:**

Today Athena and I decided we would go on day tour out of Dublin. So we booked it ahead of time and then in the morning walked over to the pick up site and were on our way!

Our first site was a very scenic site tucked in the hills of the Wicklow Mountains. What that means though is that to get there you have to go down these very narrow windy country roads. About mid way through the ride I started to feel very bus sick!

I ended up making my way to the front of the bus, because I felt that bad, but moving to the front actually helped. The tour guide told me to just watch the white line (their middle dividing line is white) and that it will give me back the sense of ‘horizon’ and I should start feeling better. Thankfully that helped, and arriving at our destination helped and I eagerly hopped off the bus.

The sights here are incredible though, and made that ride worth it. It’s an area called Glendalough, and there is an old monastery next two this ‘valley of the two lakes’. It was incredibly scenic with lots of forests near by, and one of the prettiest sights on the trip.

After spending a good amount of time here we continued out of this area, which involved a little more of being bus sick, but eventually hit the motorway and were on our way to Kilkenny, the medieval capital of Ireland for the Normans.

All the way the tour guide would either play traditional Irish music, or explain things that we were passing- from fairy trees, to the farm forests. Overall a good tour and guide experience.

In Kilkenny which is a small little town now with the charm of a medieval tourist trap, we stopped for lunch where Athena and I walked around before settling on some restaurant, where I had some Shepherds pie.

After lunch as we were rejoining the group Athena ran in to someone she knew from work! It was quite remarkable that in all of the world she would run in to someone in Kilkenny.

After a quick hello we rejoined the group as our guide walked us around the town explaining the history of some of the buildings. After the fact I realized I didn’t take many pictures of this place, and I suppose that while it by itself is probably pretty neat it with the backdrop of all that we’ve seen so far nothing stood out photographically. It struck me as a neat place to spend a bit of time though on a holiday. (Though the many street may be too touristy for an extended stay, and I didn’t see much else.)

Thankfully the ride home was almost exclusively on motorways so no windy roads, and no more being bus sick for the day!

**Day 14:**

Today will be a short blog, since I went to work today. I spent most the day catching up on email and had a catch up call as well. Grabbed lunch with some of the guys in the Dublin office that I interviewed for my old team. And last but not least joined for the Friday cantina after work. Since the Dublin office is so much smaller than headquarters (probably only around 200 people) it reminded me more of the early cantina’s I attended at Workday where it was small in the sense of total number of people, but large in the sense that it seems like a majority of the people show up. It was fun, and it reinforced my notion I started forming in Germany: that Americans drink because they like to get drunk, Europeans seem to drink because they like to have fun. Not that American’s don’t like to have fun, it just seems like it isn’t actually the primary objective of a lot of the drinking activities that ocurr.

After cantina we made our way to The Bernard Shaw pub, which is the long term home for The Big Blue Bus. Which is literally a double-decker bus where they make pizza downstairs and there is dining upstairs. It was pretty neat, and the pizza was pretty good. All in all, an enjoyable Friday.
