[](http://www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_78431.jpg)Over the past couple of months I have been finding it increasingly hard to see the front of the classroom. At first I noticed on overheads and projectors, and I just kinda blamed it on the projector not being focused correctly. Then it moved to red ink, and chalk, and then just in general if a professor was writing to small (or I was a couple rows back) even squinting I couldn’t always make out all the words.

I resigned to the fact, it was time for me to join the rest of my family and go get a pair of glasses.

I went to Costco to get a prescription and my set of frames, and a week later here they are. I haven’t really worn them much because I find them kind of annoying. And I usually get a bit nauseous and a headache. When I move my head everything kinda distorts and moves in the lens, and I don’t like having things that should be in focus when I look sideways being out of focus because of how much glass I am looking through at that angle. I’ve been told all this is normal, and that in about a week my brain will be use to it and it shouldn’t bother me anymore though. So I guess in the meantime I just need to put up with that while I adjust.

It really is remarkable, you don’t know how bad your eyes have gotten until you can see correctly again! I feel like I have super vision, and everything I look at (thats more than a couple meters away from me) has an incredible more amount of texture than I am use to seeing.

I suppose between using the computer as much as I do and my gene pool I should be grateful I made it to 20 with perfect vision!
