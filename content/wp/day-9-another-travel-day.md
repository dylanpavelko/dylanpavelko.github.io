Another day spent essentially traveling the entire day– trains, planes, and automobiles– so not too much to post about this evening.

We had some delicious asian food in the airport at Munich. Went through customs without too much hassle. Made it safe and sound to Ireland.

Between the bus ride, and exploring around to grab dinner and some breakfast foods Ireland looks fantastic. Very excited to spend the next week here exploring. A lot of the city looks quite picturesque although so far the thing that wouldn’t be captured in a picture is the kind of stale old city smell. I’m not sure if it was just the part of town we were in or if its typical of the city of Dublin. But what ever, a little stink never hurt anyone.

We went to The Old Storehouse for dinner, and were all pleased with our meals. There was live singing to keep us entertained which was quite fun as well.

I’ll keep this post short, and leave it there with hopefully lots more stories to come!
