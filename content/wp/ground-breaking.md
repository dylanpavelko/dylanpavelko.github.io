Last weekend I got to participate in the ground breaking ceremony for the new Cal Poly Center for Science and Mathematics!!

It has been about 15 years in the work but they are going to be tearing down half of Bldg. 52 (AKA: The Spider Building) and building a new multi-story building that as the Dean of the College of Science and Math (COSAM) said every student who goes to Cal Poly will have the opportunity to *enjoy* taking classes in this building. The new design does look pretty cool, although I doubt they will be near completion by the time I graduate. It was a neat experience though to be part of, the Dean of the College wanted the building to be for the students and symbolically asked each college to send a student to represent the college. (I was there representing 5,000 engineering students at Cal Poly). Also photographed in this picture is a student athelete, the ASI President, President Baker, and the Deans of each College (beside their student).
