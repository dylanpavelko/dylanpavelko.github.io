With several things on our agenda for the day, we grabbed a quick breakfast at our hotel, and headed off for our first destination: Trafalgar Square. It was a rather pretty square with some nice fountains and statues, and a pretty government building (I’m guessing).

From there we headed down the street to the British Prime Ministers house 10 Downing Street. For some reason we thought we were going to be able to walk right up and take a picture by the door. Of course we were insteaded greet by a large fence at the end fo the road and several security officers with assault rifles. Oh well, off to Buckingham Palace to see the changing of the guard.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Buckingham Palace, as well as the gardens in front of it (part of Jubilee walk way), were very pretty. Very different architecture and designs then the French palaces and gardens, but still pretty, and very English.

The area the changing of the guards was, was fairly crowded even half an hour before the ceremony began. So we decided to just hang out where we were sitting and wait. The Queen wasn’t in the palace today, which is signified by only two guards standing guard in front of the palace rather than four. Watching these guards, both before the ceremony, and during I had to wonder what the guardsmen feel about their occupation. Do they consider themselves more of security or performers? It is certainly a fine line they walk. (No pun intended).

Granted, we really didn’t have too great of a view, and I was mostly blindly holding my camera above the crowds to try and get a picture. But neither of us really found the ceremony to be all that exciting. It was neat to see, but don’t think I’ll need to feel the need to fight the crowds to see it again ever.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

After the ceremony we went and just sat on the fountain for a while to rest our feet after we had been walking on them for a few hours and then just standing still for an hour. This trip has definitely been pretty killer on my legs. Walking all day, every day. For at least the fist day of work I’ll be quite happy to sit all day in my office chair.

After grabbing a quick lunch we caught on the underground to head over to Tower Hill, to see The Tower of London. The Tower, as it is commonly known has surved many purposes over the years, but its probably best known for its current use of securing the royal crown jewels, and its most gruesome use which was as the dungeons where they held traitors to England, and where many famous individuals quite literally lost their head.

After getting tickets (which were pricier then I had expected), we went in and on Laura’s request, headed straight for the crown jewels. I have to admit, they were impressive. As someone who is not obsessed with jewelry thought, it seemed a little funny to me how much money all of this was worth, and that it sits on crowns that are never really used. What I found interesting was there was a fair amount of information about the history and process of the coronation ceremony, which I found all to be rather interesting. I’m sure we will all be learning quite a bit more about that in the coming years as Queen Elizabeth will likely soon be stepping down from the throne.

After seeing the crown jewels we got to explore the rest of the tower, where they did an interesting job of showing some torture devices, and making you go ‘eww how gruesome’ without really feeling to terrible about the fact that this was all actually used on people. (Well, they were mostly replica’s, but still). They also had much of the tower set up in to a museum of sorts of military armor and gear from the past millenium which was neat to see. They had the armor of many kings and it was humorous to see how small some of them were, or how large (rotund) some of them got in their later years on the throne. After going up and down what seemed like hundred of steps, some of them in tight spiral staircases. We continued on our way to walk across the Tower Bridge.

The Tower Bridge is London’s most iconic bridge, funny enough, it is also one of the newest. It was pretty, and after walking across it, didn’t realize how short it was. I am so use to Bridges in the Bay.

Afterwards we did even a little bit more tourist shopping, and when I say we…. I think everyone knows I mean Laura.

We stopped by the hotel and relaxed a bit, and then figured out how we were going to get to the Heathrow Airport to leave London. I’m really glad we did this then, because our initial plan may have pushed us a little late, which would have been really stressful.

We then went to some random place for dinner. It was okay, but moderately priced so worth it. And just kind of relaxed for our final hours in London, similarly to our last night in Paris. It’s wild to think how different the experiences we had in the two cities were, and how quickly it all went by.

Throughout the past few days I’ve been feeling a slight tickle in the back of my throat. And I am seriously convinced its from all the second hand smoke I’ve been around. It seems the English smoke even more then the Parisians which surprised me.

We headed back to our hotel a little normal than we would usually call it a night, because we both wanted to get our luggage situation all sorted out so we wouldn’t have a stressful morning before our flights leave.

In the process of doing this we both had rather stressful events. There was a good half hour or so where I COULD NOT find my passport. Where could it have gone? Did it get stolen? Did I leave it some where? What do I do? Where is the US Embassy? What happens if I miss my flight? Thankfully, it was just under a map on my bed. Hiding from me. The bastard.

Laura on the other hand discovered her bags were now a few pounds too heavy. Surprised? Everything ended up having to get re-organized, I am taking a few things early. (She is headed to Dublin, Ireland for a few days, while I head back to the States). And eventually we got it back down to weight. The culprit that put her over. Some 3 pound vogue magazine in French. Totally worth it right?

Anyways, all is nice and settled now and we are headed to bed before an early morning, and an especially long day for me. (Leaving the hotel at 8:30 AM and will be home around 10:30 PM… what makes this especially brutal is the 8 hour time change that is added on to this travel time)! But when I am home, I can sleep, all day!

Our trip didn’t have much down time, or too much wander around and just embrace the culture. Nor did we get to live up the nightlife scene much. But there is really no way we would have been able to do those things and see as many of the amazing sites we did.

This trip has been an absolute joy, truly a dream vacation, and as all good things do, I’m afraid this trip is rapidly coming to its end. I think I will end this post here, with the possibility of adding some final reflections when I am well rested and back in America. (or perhaps when I am bored on the plane). In any case, thanks for following along!

Cheers,
