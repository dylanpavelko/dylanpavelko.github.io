Just got back from the [Drive-In](http://www.google.com/movies?hl=en&near=san+luis+obispo&dq=sunset+drive+in+san+luis+obispo&theater=sunset+drive&ei=AyqjS7DAMojysgPo2sjfAw&sa=X&oi=showtimes&ct=title&cd=1&ved=0CAcQxQMoAA) (which consistently impresses me with the fact that I can see TWO movies for $6!) and thought I would do a little movie review of what I saw.

I went to go and see [Alice in Wonderland](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014759/), really not knowing what to expect– of course I have seen the classic [Disney cartoon version](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043274/), but haven’t actually read the book or heard any reviews of this new version– and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. It starts out in London with young Alice (the one we all know) and then quickly fast-forwards to an older (19, I believe) Alice played by [Mia Wasikowska](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1985859/) who ends –surprise, surprise– up falling down a rabbit hole! As Alice fell up and drank her shrinking potions I made the comment, “this is strange it’s like seeing a movie you already know without ever seeing it”, at which point things started to stray from the plot I was use to. Without giving up too much away Alice revisits most of the characters we all remember in a darker/[Tim Burton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318/) version of Wonderland. The Queen of Hearts (who quite possibly was my favorite character, played by [Helena Bonham Carter](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000307/)) is ruthlessly ruling Wonderland and it is up to Alice to return de-thrown the Red Queen and restore order back to the White Queen. The story moved relatively quickly, and though the end story line didn’t come as a big surprise, there were lots of sub-plot lines that kept you in some suspense throughout the movie.

The sets, costumes, and way of presenting the characters with modern technology were all extremely well done, and easily made me feel like I was in one of Alice’s dreams/Wonderland. With the truly unique setting and mannerisms of all the characters it would not surprise me if the movies fan base did not develop a fair number of cult-like obsession groups.

Two characters I would like to rag on for a just a moment, would be the Mad Hatter and the White Queen. The Mad Hatter was played by [Johnny Depp](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/), and while he had great unique portrayal of the Mad Hatter what bothered me was his dominance in both the movies plot as well as the publicity campaign for the movie. He came close to stealing the show (which would be fine if it was The Mad Hatter in Wonderland’) and literally is the only image I see on ads for the show. I know he draws that certain female-crowd, but there is such a thing as over doing it. Also his character was so eccentric I occasionally had a difficult time making out what he was saying. In regards to my complaints on the White Queen (a role that was new in Wonderland, at least from what I remember), who was played by[ Anne Hathaway](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266/), are slightly petty but are related to whoever was in charge of her make up. She looked dead, or at the very least VERY SICK. It was distracting and random from the artistic world established throughout the rest of Wonderland.

Overall fun movie, answered some questions about the back story of Wonderland, and stirred up a bit of nostaliga in me. I am giving this one a solid B+

The second movie at the Drive-In was [Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814255/)f (how’s that for a long title), I knew nothing about this movie going in and watched it simply because it was playing and I already paid to get in to see the Alice in Wonderland– so why not! It was the story about the demigod (half god/half mortal) of Poseidon who discovers he’s Poseidon’s son and has to go on a quest to find Zeus’s thunderbolt to prevent the God’s from going to war with each other/Save his mom from the under world. Apparently this was adapted from a novel, and I am going to venture a guess that it was a children/pre-teen novel.

The greek mythology interlaced in the movie was neat, and it was an adventure movie with a couple of Hollywood Big-Names, but over-all pretty predictable. Acting was pretty cheesy, and the script didn’t always help. Nothing I’d go pay money to see, but would watch one day when I was bored maybe. (Although probably not, now that I’ve seen it once). I gave the movie a C-, and that is probably being a little too nice. I think I have a soft-spot for movies where the kinda nerdy kid ends up becoming a super-hero and saving the day.
