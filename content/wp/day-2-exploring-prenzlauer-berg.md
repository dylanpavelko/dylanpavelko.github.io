Sunday in Berlin we got off to a late start. Our apartment has steel blackout curtains that we’ve been using and as a result we woke up at noon… shocked that it was noon!

After some quick showers, we hit the road in search of brunch and ended up at some Kabob place. It was pretty good, though we had to consistently defend our food from wasps (it’s wasp season, I forgot to mention them all over the place yesterday including inside some of the glass food dishes).

Our plan for the day was to explore our neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg. This started with us going to Mauerpark which on Sundays has a gigantic flea market with just about anything and everything you could imagine. From handcrafted arts to antiques, to some of the most random nicknacks: old coins, postcards from decades ago, boxes of glasses as well as a food stall area. It was fascinating to walk around.

Nearby there was an outdoor amphitheater where they had hundreds of people spectating a public display of karaoke. Various brave souls would walk up to the front and belt out their hearts to various songs. Interestingly not only all of the songs were American/English songs, but even the announcer/DJ spoke exclusively in English. Perhaps that is because none of the singers were from Germany that came up to sing, but instead from all around the world: Brazil, Holland, Ukraine, etc. It was a really fun atmosphere.

Later we decided to continue to explore various neighborhoods of Prenzlauer Berg, stopping by a historic water tower, and eventually going to a German tapas place where we got to sample a variety of German foods. Meatballs, sauerkraut, these baked potatoes, flambe tartes, bean salad, schnitzel, and a few others I’m forgetting. Everything was good and tasty. After a nice long dinner we decided to walk home and rest for a bit before we plan to go out to the clubs.
