My last full day in Ireland started, thankfully with a late-start, and then brunch at a delicious place called Green19 where I had French toast with maple syrup, peanut butter, and bananas. Yum!

After brunch we walked over for what would be my last tourist attraction, but an absolute requirement for any Dublin tourist: the Guinness Storehouse!

They actually have a pretty neat self-guided tour set up to take you through the process of making Guinness. From harvesting and roasting the barley, to storing and shipping the stout, to adverting. Overall it was a nice set-up that ended with a pouring lesson where I am proud to say I graduated as a certified Guinness Pourer. We then took our Guinness drinks up to the Gravity Bar which is apparently the tallest building in Dublin, with very nice panoramic views.

After the storehouse and a bit of shopping it was time to go back to the apartments and spend some time shuffling stuff around and packing my bags. The trip is coming to a close.

But before I take off, the main group had one last dinner at some relatively nice place down the street and it was both delicious and enjoyable. A real nice conclusion to a wonderful trip.
