A little over a year ago I changed roles at work ([Workday](http://www.workday.com/), a software company) to be a PM. What’s a PM you might ask? Is that project management? What do you actually do? Well you aren’t alone in asking, in fact, that is why I decided to take this moment to write-up something here.

![](https://i1.wp.com/d1stfe5sz9ezud.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/43a62fdb95cbe473dfb259a88705b0cd.png?resize=332%2C194)

The first issue to address, is that there are a few different jobs in the software industry that all claim the title of “PM”. There are Project Managers, Program Managers, and then there is my actual role as a PRODUCT Manager. So, ‘what’s the difference?’ asks several of my recent graduate friends…

**Project** Managers generally manage a (or often multiple) initiatives that have a fixed life-cycle. There is a beginning, and there is an end. Project Managers are expert task masters, and focus on resolving obstacles to ensure a timely, successful, completion of their project.

**Program** Managers oversee the ongoing processes of an organization. They are focused facilitators that ensure the overall success of the organization typically with a strong focus on process improvement. They often work across teams and organizations to help facilitate the process in which organizations interact with each-other.

**Product** Managers focus on the evolution of a specific product solution or application. Similar to Program Managers they typically aren’t working on something that has a defined start and finish dates but an ongoing effort to create, enhance, and then support a product.

Similar roles that are often blurred, and depending on the company, can be overlapping with Product Management are Product **Strategy**, Product **Marketers** and Product **Owners**. Product Strategy focuses on analyzing the market and providing guidance to the organization on how the product will best meet the needs of the market. Product Marketers promote the solution to the potential customers. Product Owners use the information from Product Strategy to work with product development teams to design a product, and then prioritize the development efforts of the product.

My job at Workday as a Product Manager feels like a hybrid-role between Product Strategy and Product Ownership.

So what is a typical day like?

The only thing that is really typical, is having a calendar packed full of meetings! And while many of my development friends bemoan meetings, for Product Management it’s where a fair amount of the work actually gets done. I will have meetings with customers to discuss their challenges, meetings with other product managers on what our solution will be, meetings with developers and software architects on how we can build the solution, meetings with designers and user researchers to make sure our solution provides an ideal user experience, meetings with documentation and support teams to make sure the customers are getting the right information on how to use our solutions, meetings with project managers about customers up-taking our product solutions, and yes, even *meetings about meetings to discuss all of these meetings*!

It’s intense, stressful, and at times ridiculously frustrating. But it’s also a role where you get to be creative, innovative, and forces you to learn to wear many hats. At times you have to be very technical, other times you have to communicate at a very high level, and it almost always feels like you need to be your own products’ cheerleader (for despite having the word manager in my title I’m not actually anyones manager, so there is no carrot/stick motivational methods available).

Product Management feels more like a lifestyle than any sort of 9-5 job to me, and while this was never the role I was planning on pursuing out of college, it’s something that genuinely excites me, and I find rewarding in many ways. Sitting in all those meetings aren’t so bad too, when you work with great people!

Shameless plug: If product management sounds interesting to you, interested in technology innovation, and you are at all passionate about higher education … let me know, we’re hiring!
