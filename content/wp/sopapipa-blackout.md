If you haven’t heard of SOPA/PIPA by now, you obviously don’t use the internet– in which case neither of them are likely of huge concern to you. But if you do use the internet and have just been avoiding learning about the two US Congress bills (house/senate respectively) check out this informative video. After the leap, read my opinion about the bills, the internet blackout, ‘Silicon Valley vs. Hollywood’, and other general comments.

Proponents of the bills (Chris Dodd former senator and president of MPAA) claims Silicon Valley corporations are turning its users in to pawns in this fight. But what I think he, and the co-sponsors of the bill fail to realize is that senators and house representatives represent us pawns! And we think that these new potential laws are bad for business, bad for freedom of information, and bad for America.

Below is a message I sent to CA Senators Boxer &amp; Feinstein. (Please don’t tell me about any typo’s/spelling/grammar erros… it’s too late!)

Senator Feinstein/Boxer,

While I applaud your and fellow senator’s efforts to combat online piracy. I strongly encourage you to reconsider the current legislation that is being proposed in PIPA, and withdraw your support for the bill as is.

I have no doubt that you are aware of the massive showing of support against this legislation that has been shown by thousands of your constituents, so I will keep this as brief as I can.

Today’s ‘Internet Blackout’ is trying to be pitched as a fight between two Californian industries, Hollywood vs. Silicon Valley. But I disagree, not only because this assertion is being made primarily by TV News shows (aka part of the Entertainment Industry) but because the thousands of American’s who participated in this blackout through different means aren’t part of Silicon Valley, we are American’s from all sorts of different backgrounds and affiliations. We are aware of the dangers of online piracy to American jobs and our economy, but we feel this legislation does not solve this problem, and instead creates a dangerous situation where new regulations can restrict access to important (not pirated) information and stifle new business opportunities. Its not Hollywood vs. SIlicon Valley, its Hollywood vs. Access to Information, vs. American Citizens!

The internet is still a new technology, and has dramatically re-shaped the world as we know it. Trying to write laws that force this new technology in to the old-mode of business won’t work. A new more innovative approach will be required that doesn’t endanger the internet as we know it. The way that SOPA &amp; PIPA are trying to achieve this is dead wrong!

I encourage you, despite the huge amount of support you must receive as a Senator from California (home of Hollywood and the Entertainment Industry pioneering these bill), to listen to the people you represent and echo their disapproval of this bill by withdrawing your support of PIPA.

Sincerely,
