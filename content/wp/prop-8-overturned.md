Today a Federal Court Judge overturned the controversial CA proposition banning same sex marriage in the state. While many of my socially liberal/moderate friends let the world know by posting their joyous feelings all over their facebook statuses, I find this news not as celebratory…

Not because I think that homosexuals shouldn’t be allowed to marry, but because what the hell is wrong with us Californians that we needed a judge to say this! If this was some other state, okay maybe I could understand. But we are one of the most liberal states in the US, we freaking have San Francisco (side note: I could hear “the gays” blasting ‘What the World Needs Now is Love’ at City Hall from my apartment). Are there really that many homophobic people in this state? I guess so!

And I say homophobic because, truly, that’s what I think causes people to vote for things like Prop. 8. Not because I think they actually think if gay people got married that the idea of marriage would be ruined. I think its because gay people freak them out.  
Here is my list of reasons why I think gay marriage is fine:  
1\. It doesn’t affect any one else’s marriage anymore than any other marriage.  
2\. 50% of hetero-marriages end in a divorce, so much for sacred  
2\. Similar arguments were made against mixed-race marriages…. what will the kids end up like?? Gee, I don’t know…. go ask Barack Obama!  
3\. It gives gay americans rights that straight americans have. Such as if a straight US person marries a non US citizen, its okay for the non US citizen to come to America (or its easier in any case).  
4\. To counter the argument God didn’t make Adam and Steve, that statement makes marriage a purely religous ceremony, however since there are atheists who get married and rights associated with marriage I think it is safe to say that being married in America can not and should not have to be tied with any specific religion. What if you practice a religion where God created Adam and Steve and calls a union between them marriage…. in the US you can’t deny someone the right to practice their religion.  
5\. Ellen Degeneres

I don’t know, obviously I am glad that now in CA gay people can get hitched (And quite frankly, yea it does kind of make me snicker the idea of two grooms on the top of a cake. But you know what, why should my opinion affect their ability to get married!) But it just kind of bothers me that it came down to this, and that I’m sure the court battle isn’t close to over. We Americans pride (haha, unintentional choice of word) ourselves on our freedoms, and almost everyone has heard and appreciated the quote that “those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.” It seems ironic that we continually repeat the same social injustices to minorities. Be it African Americans, Women, Homosexuals, …

I’ll end my rant with two my favorite quotes I’ve seen posted on facebook today.

> “Gay people deserve to suffer like the rest of us”  
> -Dolly Parton

> “Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license. Indeed, the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples.”
