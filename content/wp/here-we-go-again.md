Itinerary is settling, luggage is being packed, and it’s just about time to go again on another epic adventure!

I’ll be headed to Italy (Rome, Florence, and Tivoli), Germany (Munich), and Ireland (Dublin and Galway).

As usual I will be attempting to document this trip with pictures and travel blogs, which when I have time and internet I will upload [here (use this link to see all posted blogs about this trip)](http://www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/?cat=15).

Ciao for now!
