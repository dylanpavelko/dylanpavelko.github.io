My work took all of the interns out to a base ball game. It also happened to be the same day I got my new phone (more on that later). So I tested out the on phone camera. Here are a couple pictures from the game.

AT&amp;T Park (I felt awkward with my Droid in ***AT&amp;T*** Park lol)

The Droid X automatically will put panoramic photos together if you just move your camera when it says too. Pretty nifty.

This is when the Giants right before or after the Giants won… I don’t remember which.

P.S.: so I initially wrote this blog on my Droid as a test. Wasn’t really happy with how the app limited and auto-formatted some things. Like the image size/placement so I had to edit on my computer. I’ll just use the app to moderate I guess. Or text only posts.
