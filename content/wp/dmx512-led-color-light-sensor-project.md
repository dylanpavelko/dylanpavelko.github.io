This past quarter I took CPE 329,which is a Embedded Systems and Programmable Logic course, at Cal Poly. And for our final project, my partner (Jacob Power) and I designed a system that used a color light sensor to 1. duplicate colors on a LED color light fixture live, 2. Playback a pre-stored color (we also allowed the user to record and play-back new colors), and 3. Identify a gel color based on the pre-stored database of color values.

It was pretty neat, and over all I’m pretty happy with how it turned out. I still am working on the project write up, but once I’m done with that (and FINALS!!!) I might post up a little bit more about the project. For now though you can check out the demo video that our professor (Dr. John Oliver) shot!

Special Thanks to Doug Fleenor Design for letting us borrow one of his LED300’s (which he make’s and are awesome!) and one of his spare Color Kinetic LED fixtures. We definitely could not have gotten the project working as well as we did with out them!

My professor also just posted our original demo video of the color light sensor, which the presentation isn’t quite as well prepared, but you can check out a little bit more about what was inside the metal Color Light Sensor Box, and how it works!

You can also check out some of the other projects my classmates worked on this quarter too if you go to the actual youtube page, and look at the other video’s my prof has posted.
