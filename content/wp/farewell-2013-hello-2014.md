[![Colourful 2014 in fiery sparklers](https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2014-New-Year-HD-Wallpaper.jpg?resize=409%2C256)](https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2014-New-Year-HD-Wallpaper.jpg)

As we count down the remaining moments of 2013, I’d like to take this opportunity to post a reflection (especially since other than rambling travel blog posts, it has been quite a while, since I’ve posted anything personal here).

**What has this past year meant for me?**

- I moved out of my apartment, and in to a room at a friend’s house.
- I began a multi-year religious studies, self paced, project where I spent the year studying Buddhism. (2014 I’ll be focusing Christianity)
- I set a new years resolution for improving my posture, and am happy to say I stayed committed throughout the year to visiting a chiropractor and torturing my hamstrings at weekly yoga classes (something completely new for me). Though I will drop the official resolution, my posture is still far from ideal and will continue to be something I work on.
- I went on another incredible international journey. (See the many posts below)
- I bought a new car! (This was somewhat unexpected, and the result of some car problems with my old car. Can’t complain though, and love my new Mazda!)
- I spent time focusing on developing my career, and after a lot of networking and hard-work, transitioned roles at my company to a new role on a new team, and I couldn’t be more pleased with how things turned out.

As I look back I find myself pleased with the progress of another year, have readily enjoyed the companionship of friends and family, and thankful for all that has come to pass.

With this thankful attitude I now would like to turn my attention to the present moment, and share an interesting notion I was presented with this year during my study of Buddhism, as it seems fitting for this transition of the calendar year:

Only what you are experiencing right now is real. Everything from the past, is now just a memory in your mind, and everything that may come to be in the future is also just a thought you are experiencing. Of course it is true that all those things that happened in the past were once real, and that they contributed to your current reality. But now they exist simply as memories. Similarly the future will eventually be realized, but until it is the same as the present moment, it too exists only in your mind.

Depending on how you think about the past, or the future, this may cause you to feel many different things. I’d encourage you to celebrate the present moment, and feel at peace about all that has been and empowered about all that will come to be, because the only thing that is truly real is you in this moment.

Ok, I shall step off my soap box now, and offer a more straightforward wish to all of you, have a happy new year!

Cheers,  
Dylan
