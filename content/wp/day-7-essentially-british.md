The day started with a bus ride to The British Museum, along the way we drove through Picadilly Circus (a famous, and crowded expensive shopping area). Check. The museum itself was impressive for many reasons—one of them being that admission was free of charge!<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

They had many Egyptian and Greek artifacts similarly to the Louvre. One of the most significant being the Rosetta stone which was a significant discovery for decoding all of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. They had statues, and mummies, and some random corpses that were 2000 years old that had been fairly well preserved. Both fascinating and morbid at the same time.

Then we entered into a clock room, again making it abundtly clear the English are interested in keeping time. There were many neat different methods of keeping time over the centuries and it was quite fun to see some of Londons most ornate clocks.

There was also some old military gear pieces, helmets, swords, etc. and then a number of important relics over the past millenium pointing to different time periods of British history. It was all worth seeing, but didn’t find most of it particularly photo worthy. Today was dramatically a smaller photo day…. Taking about 1/5<sup>th</sup> the number of shots I have been averaging.

One interesting insight I was thinking about while viewing all these artifacts, was how similar and brief our human history has been. While that may sound surprising when you are seeing artificats from over 2000 years ago, it is remarkable to see how similar they were to us. Of course technology, fasion, and our philosophy has all changed… but at one point in time they to were walking this earth at the forefront of innovation. It’s a hard concept to convey in words, perhaps in a later edit I will capture it better.

After we got our fill of the museum, we decided to walk down Oxford street and do a little bit of shopping. I found myself two new ties, and a sweater. All very English looking. As if there was any doubt, Laura also bought a few things as well.

We then caught a bus and arrived a tad early to The Antheneaum Hotel for our fancy high tea. And fancy it was! This place clearly caters to the wealthy upper class citizens of England. Feeding us fancy tiny sandwhiches and having drinking tea and snacking turn in to quite a process. It was actually quite fun, though I doubt I’ll every pay to do it that fancy again, a good essentially British activity.

Next we decided to stay with our upperclass theme and make an obligatory stop by one of the most famous stores in the world: Harrods. This store which is housed in a building that looks like may have been a palace in its past, is just as decorative on the inside. Of course it is full of expensive flashy labels, but it also sells ordinary food. I ask you does your grocery store have a chandelier in it? Because this place does!

Both in easvedropping on conversations at tea, and just seeing articles around town, it is abundantly clear how really obsessed the English (or atleast its media outlets) are with the royal family. Adoring articles can be found all over the paper every day. It as if you combined the Obama’s, the Karadishians, and … Brad/Anjelina in to one mega celebrity family obsession. I suppose it makes sense, but it certainly seems strange to still spend so much time thinking about this family when really… they are just famous for being famous it seems.

For our last event of the day, we had tickets to Billy Elliot at the Victoria Palace Theatre. We thought this would be the perfect show to see in London, because it was both created in England, and is a story that takes place here as well. (Their English accents were perfect!) Now I had seen the movie, but it was quite some time ago and all I really remembered was that it was about a boy doing ballet and something about coal miner unions strikes. I also hadn’t seen or heard any of the numbers from the show other then the one performed at the Tony awards a couple of years ago. So we both went in with relatively few expectations of what we were about to see.

The show was absolutely fantastic! There was spectacle, and tender moments; there was ballet, but also tap and modern; there was laughter, and there were tears. All around really just a phenomenal show. If you have the opportunity to see it done, I highly recommend it! The boy playing Billy Elliot, whose character is suppose to be only 12, couldn’t have been much older was widly impressive for his age. Because he is so young, and the role is so strenuous it is normal for the role to be triple cast, with different boys playing the role alternating performances. Being such a diverse triple-threat at such a young age, I’m sure he will have quite the successful career ahead of him.

The show had all sorts of British humor and themes in it, that as an American was unique to see: many references to class differences, lots of notorious British wit, some good telling offs, and some alternative vocabulary (if you happen to bring your fanny-pack to England, you should certainly not call it that). Honestly I could go on and on about the show and their clever use of set, lighting, costumes, breaking the 4<sup>th</sup> wall, etc. But I think I will call this blog post and this evening a night!
