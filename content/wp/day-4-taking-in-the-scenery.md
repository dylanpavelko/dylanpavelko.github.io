Our third day in Paris began with a quick metro ride over to the Eiffel Tower. We got there before it even opened, and already there was a long self-forming line bending back and forth underneath the massive tower.

After looking around Laura and Kaitlin found a much shorter line that was a stairs only option (and only let you go to the 2<sup>nd</sup> platform). The reduced price, but more importantly the reduced wait-time, was certainly worth it. So I opted for that, while Laura and Kaitlin went off in search of pastries, and a place to picnic in the park beneath the tower.

The Eiffel Tower is actually a fairly controversial tower, and my opinion of it seems to go back and forth as well. The Tower was built for one of the World Fair‚Äôs that was being hosted by France. And was only suppose to be a temporary structure. Of course the world fell in love with the tower, and it became one of the most iconic symbols in the world. The decision was made to maintain it and keep it standing rather then tearing it down. The controversy comes with the fact, that many Parisians really don‚Äôt appreciate the Eiffel Tower and view it as an ugly eye-sore jutting out of their horizon.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

At first I didn‚Äôt really appreciate their point of view. And just thought those picky Parisians‚Ä¶ but seeing it in person, compared with the rest of the architectural designs of Paris‚Ä¶ from a distance it does look very industrial and not as fitting with the rest of the city as pictures make it look. I also imagined it to be a little darker, instead of the strange shade of brown it is painted. Up close however, my opinion shifted, when you can see the decorative way the metal has been crafted.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Climbing up the stairs was an experience as well. It was pretty tiring, but considering how high I was going‚Ä¶. it wasn‚Äôt as bad as one might expect. The views of course are unmatched, and I think *that* is the true gift the Eiffel Tower offers to the city of Paris. Even from the first and second floors (aka: not the top point piece) you are able to see all over Paris, and are able to pick out the famous landmarks that you have visited previously.

The weather was perfect, and I discovered perhaps one reason everyone (except the Parisians) love the Eiffel Tower, is it is incredibly photogenic. It never blinks, or makes a strange face, and looks quite extraordinary from every angle.

I was able to sneak-in to one of the elevators for the down ride (thankful not to have to walk down all those stairs again) and met up with Kaitlin and Laura in the park. There were a decent number of beggars/solicitors in this area which kept coming up to us getting us to sign something. ‚ÄúDo you speak English?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan you sign this?‚Äù It got to the point where we‚Äôd just have to shout at them as they approached us ‚Äú*NO*, go away!‚Äù Kaitlin shared with us that she heard that this is a common strategy of pick-pocketers. And funny enough when some police officers rode by on some bicycles, their ‚Äòpetitions‚Äô disappeared and they walked some place else.

Speaking of police, it is not unusual to see French military patrolling around large tourist attractions, or high density areas carrying automatic weapons. As an American ‚Ä¶ who you would think would be more use to a ‚Äòpro-gun‚Äô attitude. It is a little unsettling to walk next to.

From the Eiffel Tower we had to take a metro over to the TGV/SNCF station, to get our train situation sorted for our trip to Reims, Champagne. Our second experience with TGV was better then our first. But I still didn‚Äôt find things very intuitively labeled. (Finding out which train compartment you are suppose to be in was more complicated then it should have been). But eventually we bought out tickets, grabbed some lunch, and were on our high-speed train to Reims. Along our ride there I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how flat most of France is. It‚Äôs really quite strange as a Californian to see a perfectly straight horizon that isn‚Äôt the ocean. As we got closer to Reims however, some mountains began to form.

I had scheduled ahead of time for a semi-private tour of the region with a local tour guide. So without knowing anything other then I was meeting some guy named Cris at the train station we waited outside for him. He was a few minutes late, which brings me to my next cultural difference note. In France, time does not seem to be of the essence‚Äîunless you are talking about having more time to have a conversation with a friend. Showing up late, no big deal, waiting for your bill at restaraunts can take half an hour after you have finished all your food and they have cleared your plates. It makes our lives in America seem so incredibly scheduled, versus the attitude about time and schedules here. Close a little early, stay open a little late ‚Ä¶ depends on how the person feels that day.

Eventually we did connect though, and then went on to pick up two other groups of people (so that there were a total of 7 us in his van). What we expected to be more of a central Reims small champagne house tasting tour, ended up being a much more scenic drive all over Champagne (Reims is the capital city of the area in France called Champagne), visit some of the most historical sites, and take in the amazing views of the vineyards that produce the worlds champagne!<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

We visited both a monument and the resting place of Dom Perrignon who is considered to be the founder of the Champagne method.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

What I may have enjoyed the most, was when our guide would pull over on the side of the road, and we‚Äôd all get out take pictures, and he‚Äôd start talking about the grape growing process. And the differences between them. Then he‚Äôd pluck a few grapes off and we‚Äôd sample them. Then we‚Äôd go grab a few and sample them ourselves. Those were surely the most expensive grapes that I didn‚Äôt have to pay for that I‚Äôll ever have eaten!<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

[![](https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3671.jpg?resize=420%2C280 "IMG_3671")](https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3671.jpg)

Driving around with him was a treat, not just because he was so knowledgeable but because driving in this area seems like no easy feat. Not only are roundabouts the norm, but most of the roads seem to be narrow corridors twisting around the old historic houses. Quite enjoyable to view and drive down as a passenger, but I imagine it‚Äôd be quite stressful driving those streets as a tourist.

Eventually we made our way to a Champagne house, which was quite off the beaten path, that is being family run for 5 generations now. This was suppose to be the first of two houses we were going to sample at, but because of the relaxed attitude about time, we ended up going an hour over the scheduled end time, and didn‚Äôt even see the second place.

One was fine though. We got to go in and see where they press grapes, and store the juice to make the champagne. Unsurprisingly, it is quite the process to make.

We then went in to a room for our tasting and got to sample four different champagnes, they were all pretty tasty (I‚Äôm not a HUGE champagne guy myself). I went ahead and bought my favorite bottle, partly because I liked it, partly because it was relatively inexpensive for being real champagne, from champagne, and partly because I thought it‚Äôd be a nice souvenir for myself! üôÇ<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Throughout the tour, clouds began to form and it did sprinkle a little bit on us. It was still quite warm though, so it wasn‚Äôt too terrible, in fact it felt rather refreshing. The unique climate of the area, supposedly, is what makes the area so ideal for growing champagne grapes. But infact all the plants looked like they were thriving there, as there were many areas full of trees and wild plants that could easily be destination points on their own they were so lush. (Unfortunately no good pictures of these spots, as we were always just driving by them). I‚Äôm not entirely sure if the French love there trees, or if they just like growing here. But there seems to be many more than I‚Äôm use to both in the more country landscapes, and even in the city.

After the tour we had a little less time then we expected to explore the city of Reims. Both because our tour ran an hour late, but also the last train out of Reims was 2 hours earlier than I thought the schedule had said. So we made good use of our time and set off to find a botique Champagne shop so Laura could buy a specific brand of Champagne that is unique to the area, and then we headed out in search of the Notre Dame de Reims.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

While most people associate the name Notre Dame with the gothic cathedral in Paris, Notre Dame translates in to ‚ÄòOur Lady‚Äô as a reference to the Virgin Mary. So the cathedral in Paris, or Reims, or the other set of Notre Dame gothic cathedrals built in the time period simply are churches named Our Lady of Paris, Reims, etc.

Also while Notre Dame de Paris receives much of the fame, I would argue that Notre Dame de Reims has just as much historical value if not more. This was the church that Joan of Arc wanted the kings of France to be crowned in. And starting in the 11<sup>th</sup> century all of the Kings of France (save a select few) were indeed crowned at this site.

The cathedral itself was closed when we were there, so we just admired it from the outside. There is also supposedly a light show on the front of the cathedral at night time, but the sun had not quite set, and we needed to start heading back to the train station.

So we headed up, grabbed some ‚Äòto go‚Äô pasta. Which for the price and speed was quite good. In fact we were all surprised that there aren‚Äôt really any major fast food pasta places in America.

The day was quite enjoyable, and while we still saw a lot, and were able to squeeze a lot of things in to our schedule‚Äîit felt much more relaxed then our previous two days. With a great decrease in distance we were travelling by foot, I‚Äôm sure all of our legs appreciated it!

A sad end to the day, was parting ways with Kaitlin, who goes back to work tomorrow while we continue on our journey. It was an absolute blast getting to go to so many places with her, and taking advantage of her insider knowledge of all these little details that I would have never thought of. We‚Äôll miss you Kaitlin!! And don‚Äôt worry Paris is not only hot, but ridiculously cool too! =)

It is again well past midnight (though earlier than yesterday‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs only 1:30AM now‚Ä¶). Tomorrow we are headed to the Palace of Versailles for our final full day in France.

Au revoir!
