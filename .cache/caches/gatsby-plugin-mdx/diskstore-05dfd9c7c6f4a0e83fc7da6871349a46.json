So we turned around and went back. We were using a small google map print-out, and a downloadable map on my phone to navigate. Neither were really the same, in terms of street labels (some are in English others are in Chinese) as well as where some streets even laid-out! In any case the intrepid traveler’s that we are, we found the correct way eventually and started what should be a medium length walk to our hotel. The walk was interesting, and felt quite unlike anywhere I’ve been before. Cars drive all over, including on the sidewalk where they try to park (and do!). Everyone just goes where and how they need to, and some how without hitting each other. Time to cross the street? All right, go! Eventually we turn down this smaller alley that our hotel should be at, and head down it. It’s narrow and very “local” looking. Later we learned that this is area is known for its Hutongs (sort of like alley’s) and is more traditional of what China looked like long ago. The area is now being preserved to retain historical accuracy. There are a lot of public bathrooms (which smell quite a bit) spaced out all over but surprisingly close to one another for being a seemingly residential area.
