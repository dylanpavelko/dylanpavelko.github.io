No detail is too small to be considered and when we arrived we were greeted by all the familiar sights and sounds of Disneyland. (Humorously though, along with the typical Disney songs they played, we also distinctly heard Nutcracker music … in May! I guess they don’t realize we just listen to that during Christmas).`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_66391.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_66391.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_66391\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`We had hurried so much so, that we made up our time and ended up being at the park when it opened! We saw Snow White walking to her set, and rushed over to be first in line to take pictures with our favorite princess!`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_66481.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_66481.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_66481\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`We then got to explore the rest of Disneyland Hong Kong! It is smaller than the one in Anaheim that we are so familiar with, but surprisingly, unlike the rest of Hong Kong/China … the crowds were dramatically smaller than what we were expecting. Wait times for most rides were only 5 minutes (which is essentially waiting for the next available cart to board). It was excellent! We rode several rides that are copies of the classics from `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`our`}</em>{` Disneyland. Jungle River, Space Mountain, Small World, and it was neat to see the subtle, or sometimes not so subtle differences. There were also several rides/attractions that were unique to Disneyland Hong Kong that we enjoyed. Particularly Mystic Manor and Grizly Gulch (Disney sure likes their alliteration).`}</p>\n    <p>{`We then retreated in to the air-conditioned shops and to try scope out a place for the parade, where we knew our favorite princess would be again! The parade was fun, and it was funny sitting on the curb of Main Street, how much it felt like we could be back in California. (Minus the fact that literally the only white people were us, and the Disney princesses, and the air felt like it was made of hot water).`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_67751.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_67751.jpg?resize=280%2C420\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_67751\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`After the parade we met up with Kaitlin, who was on a break from work, got a simple lunch, and wandered the park together. We then got in line for Golden Mickey’s which is a similar show to one that Laura saw on the Disney cruise when she visited Kaitlin a few years ago. It was a pretty fun show, and it was neat to see it all in Cantonese (luckily there were English subtitles on a screen near us). Who knew that Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy all know Cantonese and English?! Those clever animals! Similar to the parade it was pretty funny to watch the show, and know immediately even when all the performers were generic, who would later be casted as the prince and princes based off of who the white people were. One other random thing that was reinforced here (and noticeably around the park) Lilo `}{`&`}{` Stitch is very popular here!`}</p>\n    <p>{`The show was fun, and afterwards we wandered back over to the It’s a Small World ride again, mostly because it had A/C. We stayed a little extra in this area, and almost started to feel like we weren’t sweating profusely by the time we left. (All day it had been quite warm, in the mid 90’s with about 95% humidity).`}</p>\n    <p>{`We then met up with Kaitlin again, and all went to go see a shortened-version of the Lion King, which had one of Kaitlin’s friends that we had met the previous night starring as Simba! The show was quite good, especially for being a 30-minute condensed-form of the story, where they had to re-tell what was going on in Cantonese after the dialogue heavy scenes. The stage set up was neat as well, being in the round, which made for a very dynamic performance.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_69331.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_69331.jpg?resize=420%2C223\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_69331\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`After this we had pretty much covered everything there was to do at Disneyland Hong Kong, so we left the park to go meet up with some of Kaitlin’s friends who would be celebrating the guy who played Simba’s birthday. Once we had all gathered (the only group of white people) we hopped on MTR and went to this restaurant in Central Hong Kong.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To get there from the station you have to take a long series of escalators running above the city streets. It was kind of neat, and served as a way to keep fewer pedestrians on the street and traffic flowing.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The restaurant we went to was actually an Australian place, and the entire area looked like a place that Westerner’s like to frequent. Everyone spoke English, some signs didn’t even have a Cantonese translation. It was quite remarkable how throughout the day, we could almost forget that, oh yes, we are in fact in Hong Kong!`}</p>\n    <p>{`It was neat to hang-out with all the ‘princesses’ after hours. They all live quite interesting lives, as many of them have worked multiple contracts at different Disneyland locations around the world. They all are definitely ‘princess pretty’, and you can tell are used to be treated a little bit like the royalty they pretend to be in the day. Really fun and nice people, Laura and I were definitely under-dressed though, so we decided to head home early from the celebrations, as we were also still running on a bit of a sleep-deficit. Even though we headed back home earlier than the rest of the group, we still didn’t get home till midnight still and were quite tired. Another fun, but quite different, day in Hong Kong.`}</p>\n\n    <style {...{\n      \"className\": \"grvsc-styles\"\n    }}>{`\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n`}</style>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
