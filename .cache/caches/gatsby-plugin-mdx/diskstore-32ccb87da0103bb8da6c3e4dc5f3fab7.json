There were all these bridges with locks chained to the fence. Symbolizing couple’s eternal love! The idea is a couple buys a lock and writes the date on it, locks it to the bridge and tosses the key in the river. Isn’t that romantic? Most locks on the bridge were only a couple months old …. Hate to be the anti-Cupid, but I’m pretty sure they have to regularly cut the locks off to keep it in control.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_2831.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_2831.jpg?resize=360%2C540\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_2831\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`A little bit further down the river we crossed Pont Neuf to the island that Paris was founded on in, something like, 52 B.C. We were then suppose to see Sainte Chappelle and their amazing stain glass windows, but some man was only letting people in with tickets, and wouldn’t provide information where you could buy them saying it was too late. (it was 35 minutes before they closed). So that was a tad disappointing, but we quickly forgot about that when we walked over to Notre Dame de Paris where again we were able to marvel in architectural beauty, and then enter the cathedral (where they were about to conduct an actual mass). This turned out to be great timing, as we got to see the cathedral in action with live singers, priest, incense burning, etc. They also weren’t too shabby on the stain glass windows.`}<span style=\"text-align: center;\">{` `}</span></p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_2856.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_2856.jpg?resize=360%2C540\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_2856\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`Now you may think clearly the day of seeing so many things is over, but no.

It was quite enjoyable! If for nothing else to give us a chance to cool off, and rest our legs. It did give us some great and unique views of different major land marks along the Sine. I ended up taking a ridiciulous number of pictures of bridges during this cruise.

But we all agreed to post-pone that to another day, and call it a night. All exhausted we piled back up to our hotel room, showered, and went to bed.

So like a fool, I’m still up!`}</p>\n    <p>{`It was a long, amazing day, where it seemed literarily around every corner was another historical site you have grown up learning about. Paris is beautiful. In the distance you can kind of see some more modern looking buildings though, and it makes me wonder how intentional preserving the historical appearance of this city has been for its city politicians.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As I aforementioned, it was a long, tiring (totally worth it and amazing) day and I probably should get some sleep before we head to the Louvre tomorrow.
