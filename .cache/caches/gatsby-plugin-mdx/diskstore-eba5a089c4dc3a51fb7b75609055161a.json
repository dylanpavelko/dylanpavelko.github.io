(As good as could be expected). Our meals were so-so, but we each had our own entertainment screen, the babies sitting near us miraculously didn’t cry, and we were both able to get maybe a few hours of shut-eye in.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Coolest thing about this flight, by far, was a camera attached to the camera that you could watch live on your own entertainment screen. We were flying over-night so most of the time it was just black, but it made for a cool take-off and landing experience! It also made you realize when the plane feels all bumpy during take off and landing, it’s not because of how fast the plane is going, it’s because its rolling over the bumps that mark where the line is!`}</p>\n    <p>{`Once we landed in Hong Kong everyone quite quickly got off the plane, (less waiting than I’m use to). As we strolled out of the plane, into our terminal, the moment we stepped off the plane we felt the beginning of what I was sure would be a familiar feeling: the humidity! Even in the air-conditioned air port you could feel it! It honestly wasn’t even that hot, just humid. Compared with Paris, which felt more muggy, this type of humidity would be better described as steamy.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We met up with Kaitlin at the airport, and all caught a cab back to her hotel/apartment in Tin Shu Wai, Hong Kong’s New Territories. Just in our short cab drive I was already impressed at the mountain ranges of these islands, all the lush greenery, and many tall buildings sprinkled across the way. It looks as if the only thing that is actually flat is the ocean around you.`}</p>\n    <p>{`One of the most immediate observations we made in Hong Kong, was how much it felt like we were in London! Minus the fact all the street signs have Cantonese writing! But since England reigned over Hong Kong until the late ’90’s there is a very heavy influence. The subway system, the bus designs, street signs reminding pedestrians which way to look before crossing, and most affectionately ‘Please mind the gap!’, are all quite similar and all also written in English underneath the Cantonese (or spoken in British accents). I’m certainly glad that we had the opportunity to go to London prior to this trip, so we could really appreciate all of these similarities.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5246.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5246.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_5246\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`Enough about similarities to London though! What makes Hong Kong… Hong Kong? We set out on our journey to see. After navigating through the public transportation system, which I must say, might be one of the easiest to use that I’ve ever had (just well-organized, even if spread out, and using of some more modern technology) we found ourselves in the Aberdeen Fishing Village on Hong Kong Island– our destination for lunch.`}</p>\n    <p>{`On this journey to lunch I kept on seeing different construction projects going on, and to my surprise where we use metal scaffolding to build up around projects in the U.S., here in Hong Kong they use bamboo!

Which is essentially a large floating boat restaurant. We decided to go there for a dim sum lunch (dim sum is originally from southern China/this area). To get to the restaurant since it is floating out in the water you need to take a ferry, we were a little confused about how that works, so we ended up finding a tour guide boat, that was going around the bay and convinced them to just drop us off at the restaurant for a few Hong Kong Dollars.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5316.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5316.jpg?resize=420%2C213\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_5316\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`The boat was very ornately decorated, and seemed quite popular. So popular, that the wait time for the restaurant was an hour! We decided to bite the bullet and wait it out, instead of going up one floor to a more western place. After all, we are in Hong Kong!`}</p>\n    <p>{`We used the time to walk around the boat, take pictures, and explore which was fun. And eventually after giving the hostess who seemed to be playing favorites the stink-eye, we got our table.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Lunch was good, but it honestly wasn’t anything spectacular that we thought we couldn’t get in California.
