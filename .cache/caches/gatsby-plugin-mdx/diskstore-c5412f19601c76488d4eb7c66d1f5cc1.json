We decided we were going to start with St. Peters Basilica and even though it was Wednesday, we had heard the Pope was not in town so he wouldn’t be giving his weekly mass and thus hopefully not as bad as crowds. As we were walking towards St. Peters Square though we kept on having random semi-sketchy guides tell us that the church was closed and they could get us “tickets with no lines” for the museum. We kind of brushed them aside, but as we approached St. Peters square we saw they had the metal detectors out and a huge group of people were in the square. As it turns out, the Pope WAS in town and he was out with a bunch of other cardinals doing some mass for all the pilgrims. It was pretty neat to see, if for no other reason that when all the people back home ask me jokingly “did you see the pope?” I can say… as a matter of fact, I DID!`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P9240603.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P9240603.jpg?resize=420%2C420\",\n          \"alt\": \"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\"\n        }}></img>{`  `}</a><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P9240586.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P9240586.jpg?resize=471%2C252\",\n          \"alt\": \"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`So after sticking around there for long enough to hear the English section, we took advantage of the distracted crowds to make our way to the Vatican Museum. Another case where we had bought tickets in advance, and I really don’t get why everyone doesn’t do this? There was essentially no line, as opposed to a LONG line for people without our pre-purchased tickets.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Vatican Museums themselves were quite impressive. Similar to the Lourve, but more densely populated with stolen art. The pieces were magnificent, but it was almost overwhelming at times where to look! The variety of art though was really impressive, from marble statues, to greek and Egyptian artifacts, to tile work, to tapestries, to famous paintings… the Vatican has it all! We did make it to see the major attractions at the Vatican Museum, including the School of Athens painting which was much larger than I expected.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P9240655.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P9240655.jpg?resize=480%2C360\",\n          \"alt\": \"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`Then we exited into the Sistine Chapel, which unfortunately had no photography was allowed. While having detailed and ornate paintings on the ceiling is not that unique at the Vatican, I think the size and scale (and of course the fact that it was done by Michelangelo) makes it a very awe-inspiring moment. The ceiling and the massive painting of Judgement day creates a very colorful surrounding. Someone may have snuck in a picture too!`}</p>\n    <p>{`Interestingly the bottom (we’ll say third) section of the church is painted to look like curtains that are drawn covering possibly additional paintings. Part of me wonders if there were grander plans for those walls or if it was intentional.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Thanks to the Rick Steve’s book we then casually exited the Sistine Chapel using the guided-tours only exit which drops you off on the front door step of St. Peter’s Basilica. (Which was nice because the line to get through the metal detectors, which we already had gone through for the museum, wrapped around more than half the square… which if you have never been or seen it is VERY long.)`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Basilica was ENORMOUS!
