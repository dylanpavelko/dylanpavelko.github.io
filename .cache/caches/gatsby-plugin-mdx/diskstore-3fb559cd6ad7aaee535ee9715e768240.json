There was this pesto pizza (basil, garlic, tomato, and some kind of cheese) on thin crust… so delicious! There was also this water fountain with water constantly running out of a spicket that people would go up to, press their hand against it, water would shoot up, and they would drink straight from it. Thirsty we followed suit and it’s strange to say, but even the water is delicious in Italy. As Californian’s in the middle of a drought though it was a bizarre sight, to just see potable water constantly flowing on to the ground.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After finishing our dinner and people watching we went in search of a market to stock up our fridge and then our way back home couldn’t help but stop at another gelato stop (this time I opted for a mango flavor) and eat our new favorite eating spot, the piazza across the street, before heading back up to our apartment to crash relatively early as we are a bit jet lag.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Tomorrow, Florence!`}</p>\n\n    <style {...{\n      \"className\": \"grvsc-styles\"\n    }}>{`\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n`}</style>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
