It was definitely more enjoyable without having to huddle under the plastic tarps, and we found a few more things that we thought were worth picking up (even if my bartering skills aren’t all that great).`}</p>\n    <p>{`We then headed home for our last night in Chiang Mai, and relaxed a little more on our porch drinking Chang beer (which we learned at the Baan Chang Park is jokingly said to be made from elephant pee, recall Chang translates to elephant). We hope to get one more sight seen before we head out of Chiang Mai to Bangkok tomorrow, but have greatly enjoyed our time in this relaxing city, with friendly people.`}</p>\n\n    <style {...{\n      \"className\": \"grvsc-styles\"\n    }}>{`\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n`}</style>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
