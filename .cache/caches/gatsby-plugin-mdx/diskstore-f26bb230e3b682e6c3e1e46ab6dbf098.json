And to think they have survived millenniums relatively undamaged (ok so there were some missing heads, arms, and for a few unfortunate male statues some important anatomical parts!).

It shows, the way these massive canvases curved around the two circular rooms just made for an incredibly peaceful atmosphere.

The art in this museum was dramatically different then the very realistic paintings we had been surveying all day at the Louvre and it was neat to see the style change. It was as if we we spent the day walking down a timeline of art. I can only imagine how much more I would have got out of this day if I had a stronger art history background, if I was so thoroughly impressed with the little knowledge I did have (combined with Laura and Kaitlin chiming in their knowledge).`}</p>\n    <p>{`One interesting observation I noticed as a common trend amongst all the art I saw from ancient Egypt to the past century. We as a human race have an incredible interest in ourselves. I would venture a guess to say, as much of 90% of the art, featured the human form.

(More where the artists live, than where a wealth of their work is on display.) Here we climbed the steps to see Sacre Coeur and its views of the Paris skyline. Perhaps I am already getting jaded, they were nice, but not necessarily my favorites (the landmark or the views). Don’t get me wrong, beautiful, just not my favorite. The area around the Sacre Coeur was also quite crowded with what were sure to be fellow tourists, both walking up the stairs, and resting/eating on the lawns. There were also an excess of street vendors in the area which were a bit more in your face then other places.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We then walked around Sacre Coeur and found a nice little place to have dinner. Appetizer + Dinner + Desert = 14 Euro…. Not bad. The food was also delicious. Laura and I both ordered the Beef Bourginion which was tasty, while Kaitlin got somet kind of vegetarian dish that had a unique kind of cheese, and then we all shared a merlot. Without doubt the most interesting food eaten at the table was escargot– which Laura ordered as an appetizer, and I did in-fact try one! (Snail is now tops the list as the strangest food I’ve ever eaten). I don’t know that I would ever order it again, but it wasn’t `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`that`}</em>{` bad.

It looks kind of pretty in pictures, but really not quite the same as history, and movies depict it as. The entire walk there, the streets are lined with different kind of sex shops, from naked shows, to “erotic art” museums, to strip clubs. It kind of shined a light on the fact that, that this is the Moulin Rouge’s origins as well. What was also peculiar about this area was that the majority of the signs were in English. Clearly targeting tourists.

Many area’s are a tight squeeze, even for us skinny people. And I begin to see how other countries can begin to build the reputation that America has a majority of rather over-weight people. Because Paris doesn’t, one wouldn’t really be able to get around easily. Speaking of not being able to get around easy. Time and again I was encountering areas that seemed to be only accessible via stairs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It made me curious what kind of Disability Access laws they have, because in America that seems to be a prominent component to the accessibility of essentially anywhere. (And rightly so). Specifically travelling in the underground metro, which is a maze of tunnels connecting different routes, with several sections of stairs you might have to go up and down 2 or 3 just to get to your connection train. How a person in a wheel chair would navigate around here is beyond me.`}</p>\n    <p>{`My final cultural difference that is rather obvious here as an American, is the difference in attitudes towards PDA (public displays of affection). Perhaps we are just a bunch of prudes in America. But where we might find it odd to see people kiss on the lips in the states. It’s really not unusual to walk by a full on make-out session taking place … well anywhere. Not that there is anything wrong with it necessarily, it just is noticeably more common and acceptable here.`}</p>\n    <p>{`All in all, a spectacular day where incredible doesn’t even do it justice.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It is now late… or rather early in the morning here, so I am going to end it here.
