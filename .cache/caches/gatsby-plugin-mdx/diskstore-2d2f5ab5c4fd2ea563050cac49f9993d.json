Whenever you are done with a transaction everyone bows/nods to each other. Perhaps its just as routine as our ‘please’ and ‘thank you’s but it comes across as sincere.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Our hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to the night bazar, which feeling rested enough we decided to take advantage of. As we started to drive though, we noticed some raindrops start to fall! Worried, since neither of us had brought our umbrella’s that night, we were pleased to find that between the tarps all the shop keepers were ready with, and the warm Thai night, the rain wasn’t really a problem. (I wore my sandals, shorts, and a T-shirt all night).`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7076.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7076.jpg?resize=283%2C420\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_7076\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`The night bazar was colorful, and full of things that looked quite unique, until you walked down and saw an almost identical booth a few blocks away.

Lady boys are, exactly what they sound like… ladies, who are actually boys. I had heard about this previous to my trip, and was under the impression they were easily mistaken to be female. At least this group of lady boys were quite clearly … lady BOYS.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7084.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7084.jpg?resize=392%2C261\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_7084\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`We grabbed dinner at a place that looked okay, it was actually hard to find anything that looked to appealing to us in this area as I get the feeling it’s primarily a tourist shopping spot.
