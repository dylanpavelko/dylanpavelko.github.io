The inner circle portion of the stage was made of several segments that would raise and lower, as well as having many fountains connected to it that would shoot up water! What really made it unique though was when the stage would lower far enough, it would become submerged in water turning the show into a part aquatic show. The show was full of spectacle, incredibly talented performers, and technical marvels (think a Cirque du Soleil style). Sure it didn’t have a lot of plot (loosely about a romance between a western man and an eastern girl), and might have been a little disconnected at times, but was incredible and absolutely worth it!`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_63451.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_63451.jpg?resize=403%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_63451\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`After that show we wandered through the casino portion of the hotel (where no photography was allowed, though it didn’t look like anything special, so I don’t know why). And eventually came upon the ‘Bubble Show’, which was a 360 degree projection show. It also didn’t really have a plot that I could explain (something about dragon statues coming alive), but was a pretty cool experience and well-done in my opinion.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_64461.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_64461.jpg?resize=420%2C252\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_64461\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`Both performances surprisingly allowed pictures, which was pretty unique I thought.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Following the Bubble Show, we crossed the street to Macau’s Venetian, an almost identical copy of the one in Las Vegas!

One of those many small dishes kinds of place that have a focus on quality over quantity, and kind of pricey for what we got. It was all very good though and was claiming to have won all these awards.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_64941.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_64941.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_64941\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`After dinner we had to rush back to the Ferry station, and after literally running around trying to find a shuttle ended up taking a taxi, not wanting to chance missing our Ferry out of Macau! It was a long series of public transportation connections to get back to our hotel from Macau, but we did make it back, quite tired but also pleased with our day. Though we didn’t get the chance to explore too much of Macau, it was nice to have a little bit of a lighter day as Laura and I both agreed we seem to be running on a greater sleep deficit than previous trips.`}</p>\n\n    <style {...{\n      \"className\": \"grvsc-styles\"\n    }}>{`\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n`}</style>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
