She told us a little bit about the itinerary for the day, and then somehow deviated a bit into Thai politics. Apparently there are many political parties here, though really only two prominent ones, and what she complained about the most was that the politics is turning into a game of who can buy more votes. The current prime minister, their first female one, for example is a multi-millionaire who owns several media channels as well as the wireless data companies.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Driving through more rural Thailand was interesting, and you can definitely recognize that it’s still a developing nation. Large sections of the road are being constructed, seemingly for the first time as the pavement just cuts out from time-to-time. Also the buildings along the side of the road can be anything from modern-day house and shops, to shacks made out of bent metal. Places where there were houses looked crowded together and small, but there wasn’t any shortage of land. Large open area’s for farming (jasmine rice), and just open space were plentiful. Many of the houses and shops also had these mini temple podium stands that I thought were interesting. Also interesting, if not overwhelming, were the number of pictures and monuments to the Thai King and Queen. Since he has been reigning for so many years there is a wide array of different aged photos and monuments everywhere you drive it seems you are in sight of one.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7200.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7200.jpg?resize=420%2C237\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_7200\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`After our introduction to Thai politics, and drive, we arrived at our first destination, the Royal Summer Palace. This is one of the get-away palaces for the Thai Royal family, though they don’t commonly use it today. Much of the palace was actually designed by one of the former Kings who grew up in Europe, so there is a heavy European feel to the design and architecture of the entire place. Our guide explained for the Thai people seeing this was very unusual; since most Thai structures are made of wood and very few would have ever been to Europe.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We then drove to the Chao Phraya River, where we got to ride on a longboat around the river bends. It was neat to see, relaxing, and felt good to have a breeze going past us on this very hot day. There were also a bunch of locals throwing bread to feed a swarm of some kind of large fish at the dock where we got on our boat that was rather interesting.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7247.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7247.jpg?resize=420%2C190\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_7247\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`After our boat ride we went inside one of the temples where some ceremony was going on. Today actually is some sort of Buddhist Holiday apparently. In the temple there were many Buddha statues, all in front of a MASSIVE gold-colored Buddha statue! As part of the ceremony they were wrapping orange fabric around him like the robes the Buddhist monks where. It was interesting, but also hot and crowded so we checked it out, and then left.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7269.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7269.jpg?resize=257%2C420\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_7269\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`We then went to where the ancient temples were in this city. The city, Ayutthaya, actually use to be the capital Thailand, back when it was called Siam. But after many wars with Myanmar/Burma it left the wood-built city burnt to the ground and its temples abandoned, as the capital city moved to what is now known as Bangkok.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7289.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7289.jpg?resize=320%2C431\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_7289\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`While definitely in a state of ruin, the old temples made of brick and concrete did survive, and are really quite impressive as a glimpse of what the old city must have looked like. We explored several different areas of these temples and were quite impressed with the scale, and design of them. We also felt a bit like we were walking around the set of an Indiana Jones movie!`}</p>\n    <p>{`The heat was really quite intense at this point in time, and I felt like my entire face was pouring out sweat. We walked through this shaded market area where we tried a couple different treats, both of our favorite was this desert similar to a crepe, which hand sugar string wrapped inside. The description doesn’t really do it justice, but it really was tasty!`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7353.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7353.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_7353\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`Extremely glad to get back in to our air-conditioned van, we made our way to lunch where they brought out a few different dishes for us to try. They were all okay. We are finding it hard to find food here that isn’t fry-your-face-off-spicy, but still has some good flavor to it. Lunch was along the river though, so at the very least it had a nice view.`}</p>\n    <p>{`That concluded our guided tour, and we were driven back to our hotel in Bangkok. Excitingly we drove through a thunderstorm. It was sunny in Ayutthaya and sunny in Bangkok, but during the hour drive we went through thunder and lightning and quite heavy rain.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Once back to our hotel we went up to the pool, which was indoor and relatively fancy. The water seemed too cold considering the temperature though, so I opted to just lie in the chairs that were sitting in the water so I could get my limbs wet, while Laura floated around the chilly pool. We then retired to our room to rest a bit, here at the end of week two one can definitely feel the constant traveling starting to wear down on your energy.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For dinner we were debating between going back to the mall, which wasn’t that good but we were familiar with it, finding a restaurant which would be a total crap shoot on our own… or likely over priced if recommended by our hotel (and probably requiring a taxi), or we found this pamphlet in our hotel with some suggestions and one was this street food a few rail stops down. We decided to try that out and see if it was any good, and to our delight we found some great food there. We both got some barbecued pork on a stick that was really tasty, and then some mango over sticky rice with coconut milk. It was all really tasty, and all really cheap! This is the Bangkok we were looking for!`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7363.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_7363.jpg?resize=280%2C420\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_7363\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`We decided that it was time though to head back to the hotel though and pack up, as we’d be leaving Bangkok the following day, Laura back to Hong Kong, and myself back home.
