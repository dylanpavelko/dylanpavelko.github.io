A few hours later we joined them waking up, and excited to be meeting up with our tour guide for the following two days. We gathered all of our stuff and went to the lobby where we met Fiona, our guide. Thankfully she spoke great English. This became important immediately when, while trying to check out of our hotel the staff brought down two hand towels and told us they were dirty and we’d need to be charged for them! One we knew would come clean with water, and the other we were all certain we didn’t get dirty. Additionally our room when we arrived in it had sheets with different dirt spots on them. We didn’t let those spots bother us at the time, but the fact that they were now trying to charge us for soiled linens when they gave us soiled linens seemed unfair, and we told them we weren’t going to pay for them. They were insistent and so we told them about the sheets, which they went and got as well. They then began to tell us (well Fiona our guide who was stuck in the poor translator spot of this tricky situation) that they would never put out dirty sheets and that we must have soiled them as well. But since we both made mistakes (ours, not telling them when we first checked in that the sheets were dirty, and theirs, that they didn’t notice the dirty sheets during their room check, not that they put them out in the first place) they found the sheets hard to explain. It was really frustrating because they were so insistent that the mistake could not have been theirs and that we would need to pay. We continued to stand our ground until eventually we decided we were wasting time arguing when we should be enjoying our day, and we told them that we’d just leave them bad reviews and pay for it. At which time the staffs tone changed, and they really wanted to try to make sure that they did not get a bad review, and let us know they just work there, and that they have no reason to try to do this to us. But were still going to charge us for the hand towels! We ended up saying what ever and paid for the sheets, and all plan on warning our fellow westerners about this hotel. Not only is there clearly not a ‘customer is always right’ attitude, but to give bad service and still expect a good review was surprising to all of us. Their excuse being that here in Beijing, the capital city, they would never put out dirty linens. Well they did. Annoyed, but all agreed that we would put that behind us and have a good rest of the day we walked out with our tour guide to our driver! A driver!

Essentially being sex slaves to the Emperor, it was not uncommon for concubines to conspire to kill the Emperor they hated him so much!`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5420.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5420.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_5420\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`This strange way of talking about the Emperor kind of became a running trend with my opinion of how the Chinese acted. Similar to that in the hotel, it felt like what they were saying (the Emperor is highly respected, the sheets could not have been dirty) was not necessarily true, nor is it what they felt (many people didn’t like the Emperor, they wanted us to not think badly of the hotel). It’s kind of strange to express in words, but there is a strange dichotomy in speech versus truth here. Almost as if what is said, should be considered as truth, and on the surface is accepted to be so, even if everyone knows it may not be.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It was interesting to walk around this area, as we began to compare it to the Palace of Versailles, which we had all visited the prior year.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While we were in one of the palace gardens, we ran in to a group of Chinese school children who very bashfully tried to have a conversation with us in English. You could tell they were quite afraid, and embarrassed and would all discuss amongst themselves before finally deciding what to ask us. “Where are you from?” And you could tell they were so excited when we would answer back. Eventually you could tell they were starting to get overwhelmed, and the main spokesperson of the group kept getting told `}{`*`}{`something something in Mandarin`}{`*`}{` ‘Nice to meet you’ `}{`*`}{`something something`}{`*`}{`. Eventually she got the courage to say it herself, and we all took a picture together.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5511.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5511.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_5511\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`After checking out the Forbidden City, we got picked up by our driver again and had a nice Chinese lunch, where Fiona ordered us several plates for us to try. It was essentially an all you can eat meal, as she kept on asking if we should order something more. It was also quite interesting during lunch just to chat with Fiona about food. Different customs around drinking tea for example (you should never pour the tea-cup all the way full, and tapping the table is a way of saying thank you). Also there is a very strong belief of ‘you are what you eat’ in the sense that, they consider everything they eat with its health benefits. For example if you are cold you should eat something to make you hot, and visa versa. However things that make you cold, aren’t always cold food just a certain type of food. In fact, regardless of how hot it is we always had tea and hot foods because the hot tea was supposed to help with your digestion.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After lunch we all piled back in to our car to drive to a section of the great wall called Jiankou, which is known for being very beautiful, but quite difficult to climb. The drive was nice (until the windy roads at least) and the high ways were surprisingly modern. Almost the entire way there, there were tall, skinny, straight willow trees planted. They looked like they couldn’t have been very old and I suspect they likely were all planted in anticipation of the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Perhaps to help with the temperature, and pollution, but I also suspect to sort of act as a screen of any less sightly places of their capital city.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Once we got off the main high way and started driving to our specific site of the great wall, the road became quite windy as we twisted and turned through small villages. You could tell they were a combination of farming, and tourist villages that in general were rather run down. Despite all starting to get a little car sick, the ride was just beautiful. The hills incredibly green, and just a gorgeous landscape. Eventually we met up with another van which guided us down a road that was not open to the public.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5525.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5525.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_5525\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`We turned out in a dirt roundabout area where we gathered all of our things for the night (because we were going to be camping on the wall!!) and started our hike up to the wall. The hike, while steep, was absolutely beautiful! Everything was so incredibly green, and there were all sorts of plants I didn’t recognize. Our guide that we had met mid way, had a large backpacking pack, as well as a bar-be-que unit, and was carrying it all for us, which was so nice!`}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally we reached the wall and found a spot we could climb up. This section of the wall, unlike many other popular tourist sections, is all-original and has not been restored at all. Because of that though it was quite run down, and most parts were falling apart. The mail path, for the most part, was still intact, but the majority of the protecting walls had long fallen down. And many of the stairs were falling apart.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Ecstatic we were like school kids climbing around a new play ground; except for the very occasional hiker (in total there were 3) we had the entire section of the wall to ourselves. It was just incredible, and we consistently would just have to pause and remind ourselves, ‘We are on the great wall! This is amazing!’`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5657.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5657.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_5657\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`We all then climbed up to one section to catch sunset over the great wall, which was just beautiful, and I’m certain my pictures won’t truly do it justice. So thrilled with the experience we were all having we carefully climbed back down to where we had set-up camp on a section of the wall, and our guide was finishing barbecuing our dinner.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We all ate dinner and shared some beer together, which was delicious after our long day of hard hiking. We were quite tired, but just delighted with our day (especially compared to the first day we had in Beijing). We spent the evening talking about all sorts of random things with our guide Fiona, which was really fun just to exchange different customs or thoughts about our different cultures, or just random beliefs. For instance she explained to us that the hair on cats, causes women to not be able to get pregnant. Really? We all found that pretty funny, but decided not to disagree. Perhaps that is how they explain ‘the cat lady’. We talked about family customs, and relationships from dating to gay marriage. It was really interesting and though there are certainly differences in customs, we really are all humans, just trying to do the right thing. It was also funny to see throughout the trip, what things about America would surprise her, as she’d respond with an emphatic “Really?!”`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5814.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5814.jpg?resize=320%2C345\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_5814\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`It began to get `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`REALLY`}</em>{` windy, so we all decided to call it a night and crawl in to our tents. Laura and Kaitlin shared a tent, while Fiona and I each had our own. There was also a guy who was hiking the wall as well who set-up camp with us. We all got ready, and lied down. Being 6’1″ I barely fit in my tent, and laid diagonal. Even with the pad under my sleeping bag, sleeping on the wall was quite hard. But what was definitely the most distracting was the wind which continued to blow hard on our tents. You could feel as you tried to sleep your entire tent shake around you, not to mention the sound. The poles would slide across the stone ground, and at first I mistook the sound for zippers opening which had me a little startled. The wind was really strong, and after a while I began to hear a lot of giggling coming out of Laura and Kaitlin’s tent. Assuming they were finding the intense wind as humorous as I was I started laughing too. Fiona our guide asked, “What are you laughing at?” Getting control of our giggles (for a moment) I climbed out of my tent because I began to hear more commotion. Apparently what really spurred the giggle-fit in the tent next to me, was our tour guide’s tent (with her inside) had blown on top of Laura and Kaitlin’s tent. We all began to laugh really hard, as we grabbed flashlights, and thankfully the guy who happened to stop with us to camp knew a thing or two about tents, and came out to help us reset Fiona’s tent. It was absolutely hysterical, and we all went back to bed (or at least tried to) thinking … did that just happen? Were we just trying to sleep on the wall while our small Asian tour guide blew on top of us in her tent? What a day, what a night!`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5826.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_5826.jpg?resize=280%2C420\",\n          \"alt\": \"IMG_5826\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n\n    <style {...{\n      \"className\": \"grvsc-styles\"\n    }}>{`\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n`}</style>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
