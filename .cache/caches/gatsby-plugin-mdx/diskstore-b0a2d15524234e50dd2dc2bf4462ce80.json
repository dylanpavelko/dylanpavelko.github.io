Yesterday my grandpa and I went around to look at different places I had appointments for. The first one I looked at cost more, and simply put was scary. I guess, it would have been tolerable if I had to live there, but everything just looked dirty: the manager, the halls, the elevator (the one that worked), oh‚Ä¶ and the studio (broken appliances, bugs on the fridge). It was hard to look at because at the time I was facing with a very realistic possibility of having to live in the place. (On the plus side if I ever wanted to buy crack‚Ä¶ I bet I know where I can find some üòõ )`}</p>\n    <p>{`So after being told to give ourselves our own tour, we looked around and were pretty quickly off to see our second place and very hopeful that this one would be nicer (but nervous because it wasn‚Äôt as expensive) . Luckily, it was! Contrasted by the manager who came out from some back room after several ‚ÄúHello?!‚Äùs in a dirty tank top, this complex had several individuals working on leases, all professionally dressed in a glass room office. The building was clean (the outside perimeter is a little dirty) But talk about night and day! It has a pool, a fitness room, laundry rooms on every floor, and the studio was way nicer (not to mention I didn‚Äôt feel like I would contract a STD if I touched the walls!) Oh did I mention the utilities (all but internet) are PAID! `}{`*`}{`cha-ching!`}{`*`}</p>\n    <p>{`Additionally the place comes furnished with a bed (which is new), table, dresser, love-seat, lamp, and night-stand! The management specifically the person I dealt with (Ian) was excellent! My place faces Market St., which is one of the main roads downtown (where I am) so I expect things to be a little bit noisy (at all hours).
