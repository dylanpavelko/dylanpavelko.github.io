The entire atmosphere in the hall was quite neat.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It did end much earlier than we were anticipating though, so with our extra time Athena and I made our way over to the National Museum of History – Archeology. This museum, also free, covers archeological artifacts and Irish history over the past 4 millennia (give or take a few centuries). For what ever reason I didn’t take any pictures here, but it was quite impressive to see the type of artifacts they found and admire their craftsmanship from era’s that I would have expected our Neanderthal brethren to be inventing the wheel! Much ahead of that, they had metal kettles, gold jewelry, weapons, and more. It was then neat to walk through the history of Ireland and see artifacts from the Christianization of Ireland, the invasion of the Vikings, and later the Normans, and the influence it had over Irish art, culture, and way of life. I was particularly a fan of the celtic style of art La Tène.`}</p>\n    <p>{`They also had some bog bodies in this museum, which are some incredibly preserved human remains found in the bogs of Ireland. A bog is kind of like a swamp, or wet land, and because there is no oxygen the bodies remained incredibly intact for centuries. Obviously decayed in many ways, but still remarkable to see a torso of a man over 1,000 years old and see his skin and his hand look not all that different than the one connected to my body. Both gross and cool at the same time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After the museum Athena and I parted ways and I headed over to the Google Dublin office to meet up with Brian and experience the Google lunch experience. Impressive office, and impressive lunch catering. I think I’ll leave it at the simple fact that I am jealous!`}</p>\n    <p>{`After my tour of the Google Office, well really just one of their buildings which includes the pub. That’s right, the pub! I headed over to Dublin Castle, the location to the British ruled over the island for several centuries. The Castle is more along the lines of a palace, but when the original castle was rebuilt several hundred years ago the ruling person (can’t remember if it was the King or one of his “vice royals” decided that the site should continue to be named Dublin Castle even though the castle walls would be coming down.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/dylanpavelko.smugmug.com/Travel/Salute-Proste-Slainte/Day12/i-5hxF7xC/0/L/PA010102-L.jpg?resize=480%2C360\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`Upon arriving, it turns out that Wednesday some tour options aren’t available, but the ones that are available are free. Perfect! I grabbed a wrist band for the next time, which was more than an hour later so with my spare time I thought I’d make my way over to the Grand Post Office, which was near by and apparently historically significant because of it’s role during the ….Irish Revolution? Other than a few broken pieces of pillar in front of the post office, the post office wasn’t much to see so I bought a couple of stamps and headed back to the castle.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Before popping back in to the castle though, I swung around back to check out the Dubh Linn Gardens. This is now a sort of ‘secret-garden’ feeling place behind the castle, but is on the site that was once a lake that the Vikings built their city around. The lake was dark, or black and in the language of the time was called just that Black Lake, Dubh Linn. The lake is no more, but the name continues on as the namesake of the city of Dublin.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I still had plenty of time, so I went upstairs to the rooms for a self guided walk through the fancy rooms the royals use to occupy. They were very nicely decorated, a combination of originals and restoration work. While the rooms were quite nice to look at in their own right, perhaps the most interesting thing happened by chance. And that is that somewhat awkwardly us common folk were kind of shuffled around the place and had certain paths made temporarily unavailable to us as a VIP was having a tour given to him. Turns out it was the Prime Minister of Slovenia! Neat for a few reasons, 1- because I saw the Prime Minister, 2- there wasn’t actually that much security considering it was a head of state (then again, only slightly embarrassed to say, I couldn’t point to you on a map where Slovenia is actually located), but 3- it gave me a small taste of what it must have felt like to not be a royal in this city, and have privileged individuals have unequal opportunities then my own. I suppose this sense of privilege is more prevalent than I care to pay attention to, but this was very in your face.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In any case after the hoopla of the prime minister leaving died down, our tour began of the underground medieval sections of the castle. There isn’t a whole lot that remains, but considering how old it is, still impressive. The guide pointed out the towers that were original, and then took us underground and illustrated for us with pictures and then pointed out in the rubble where original building pieces were. From bridges, to stairs leading in to the castle from the moat it was a short but neat experience.`}</p>\n    <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Afterwards my feet and legs were quite sore where I rested for a bit before meeting up with Brian and one of his coworkers who I had also had lunch with and we all went out to a pub named The Duke, where there is a very intimate setting improv comedy performance upstairs. The performers were quite good, and lot’s of laughs were had.</span>\n\n    <style {...{\n      \"className\": \"grvsc-styles\"\n    }}>{`\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n`}</style>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
