Thus ‘ending’ the monarchy.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We had a guided tour scheduled for 9:30, Laura realized when my alarm went off that … perhaps we should have gotten up a little earlier to make sure we could make the tour. Panicked that we wouldn’t be able to get in until the next tour (not until 2PM) we rushed out the door and did end up missing the 9:30 tour. (Even though we did have little or none issues navigating the RER Transit system today) Luckily the information on the site wasn’t entirely accurate, and we were able to joining a 10:15 tour.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3815.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3815.jpg?resize=420%2C218\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3815\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`This was an English speaking small tour group (of about 10-15) tourists, where we were led to some areas of the palace normally restricted to the public. Not to sound too special, they are clearly designed for the public to see, and observe, they just aren’t part of the main self-guided tour. Because of this though, the rooms were preserved much better and had a lot of the more expensive and delicate furniture. Our tour guide was also incredibly knowledgeable not only on the history of the French monarchy and the palace, but even the accuracy of each of the room. She would often point out what pieces were not actually ever in Versailles, and were instead borrowed from a different house that the king owned, or when things were staged to show how they likely appeared.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3825.jpg\"\n      }}>{` `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3825.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3825\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`The private tour included the private apartments of the King, as well as the apartment adjacent to his which housed different royal family members over time. Each of these apartments are many rooms connected by what appears to be two sets of double doors. However it was pointed out to us that, the two sets of doors is often mearly an allusion, and that one of the doors is fake and only serves the purpose of creating a more symmetrical design (which apparently was big then).`}<span style=\"text-align: center;\">{` `}</span></p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3838.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3838.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3838\"\n        }}></img></a><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3825.jpg\"\n      }}>{`  `}</a></p>\n    <p>{`We then went on to see one of the smaller dining rooms that the King would eat, and entertain guest, at– as well as a game room right next door. After this we got to go and see the opera house, and as Laura and I are both theatre geeks, this was quite fun. It was built to hold 1,000 people, but by todays seating accommodations is closer to 600. One interesting fact about this theatre is that they decided to build it only 26 months before they needed it to be complete to stage an opera. In order to achieve this goal they had to work day and night, 7 days a week, and the entire theatre is made out of carved wood—and then painted to look like marble, or gold-gilded statues.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3843.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3843.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3843\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`This ended our semi-private tour, and we were then instructed to join the masses for the self-guided audio tour through the palace. This part of the trip was probably the least enjoyable for me. It was extremely crowded (even though attendance was supposively not too bad that day), and the self-pacing audio tours resulted in everyone not being really aware of their surroundings and being rather pushy– or alternatively stagnate in the middle of pathways. The rooms themselves while of course lavish were not quite as accessible and seemed more likely to be recreations of the real thing, then real pieces. And as I saw, likely for good reason. There was glass paneling over some walls where fabrics were hung, and I would see some random guy reach up above the paneling to feel what the fabric was like. Yes sir, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`YOU`}</em>{` aren’t going to destroy the fabric by touching it. But if all 10-20,000 daily palace visitors touched everything, there would be nothing left to see besides dirty rags.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Because of the amount of guests the palace see’s, certain sections of the palace have to replace their floors every 5 or so years.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Eventually we made our way to perhaps the most well known section of Versailles—the Hall of Mirrors. While it too was fairly crowded, it was still quite beautiful. After seeing the rest of the lavish palace, and knowing this was coming, it didn’t strike me as being so over the top. But looking back on pictures now, it really is quite spectacular. It was halls like this that made the people of France revolt against a monarchy system who was so out of touch with their people, to live their lives and build palaces like this one.`}<span style=\"text-align: center;\">{` `}</span></p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3861.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3861.jpg?resize=384%2C600\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3861\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`The tour then ended rather abruptly after that, and so we grabbed lunch at a café called Angelina’s, which has some of the best (and supposedly most famous) hot chocolate I’ve ever had!`}</p>\n    <p>{`One detail of the morning I had left out so far, because it hadn’t really been an issue with us wandering the palace halls, was that it was lightly raining that day. This became much more relevant to our afternoon as we wanted to see the famous palace gardens. So to make a long story short, we sucked it up—and got drenched!

Needless to say, Laura was in awe of this historical figure she has been fascinated with for so long.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3924.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3924.jpg?resize=360%2C540\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3924\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`Marie Antoinette, for being famous for being out of touch with her people, uttering the words ‘let them eat cake’ during a bread/food shortage in France, had a remarkably less lavish room set-ups. Perhaps it hasn’t been as fully restored as the main palace. But I found most of these places to be much more livable then the main palace. And it was still plenty over the top with its fancy furniture, paintings, and chandeliers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We then hopped on a tram to make our way back to the main palace (and hopefully stay a little drier). However it stopped half way back to the Palace, and seemed like it wasn’t going to go any further. Tired of asking ‘parles vous anglais?’ we just decided to walk back the rest of the way. This was probably the best decision we made all day. While walking back, several of the fountains were turned on and we got to see them in their full glory! (Ok, full glory would probably be a warm sunny day…. but they were still impressive). They were all greatly out done however when Laura led the way to discover the musical fountain show. This fountain was a show set too music, and for any of those who have seen the water fountain shows in Las Vegas, or World of Color …. while they may have the upper hand with fantastic lighting—I could argue that this was much more elegant than anything else I have seen. And ended up being the highlight of this destination for me.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3961.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i2.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3961.jpg?resize=420%2C204\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3961\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`We then walked the rest of the way to the palace, attempted to find a macaroon shop and failed, and decided to call it done. While we saw just about everything the public has access too, it was still a fraction of the entire palace which is just a massive site that housed not only the royal family, but much of the royal court and their attendants.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So we caught our train back to our hotel in the center of Paris (successfully I might add, even with a transfer stop) and took some needed time to dry off and rest our legs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For our final dinner in Paris we decided to look up some place a head of time that had some good reviews and was close by. When we actually got to the place it was empty though, and it didn’t look like it had a French menu. Nervous, we decided to keep looking and see if we could find something else we liked. Just down the block from our hotel we found this small little restraunt that looked good, and had a fair number of people. We went in only to find out a group had reserved the entire inside, but we could dine out on the sidewalk (as is common here) if we chose. It had stopped raining, so we went with that option.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Despite having an English menu, this was perhaps are hardest language barrier situation we had been placed in. The waitress knowing we spoke English, other then a few choice English words she’d say to us, mostly talked to us in French. Surprisingly though we were able to order and proceed fairly normally. Our last day here, and we might finally be scratching the surface of getting use to it all!`}</p>\n    <p>{`The food seemed to be very traditional, and was extremely delicious. Likely the best meal we’ve had so far. We both ordered some form of cooked duck for our main meal (another first for me, believe it or not). This while I’d be nervous to try anywhere, tasted really good prepared here in France! Then for dessert Laura had an orange crepe, which she raved about from bite one, and I had a delicious crème brulee.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3982.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i0.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3982.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3982\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`After dinner we walked around the neighborhood where we are staying a bit, and took our last gander at the Eiffel Tower at night all lit up.`}<span style=\"text-align: center;\">{` `}</span></p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3985.jpg\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.dylanpavelko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_3985.jpg?resize=420%2C280\",\n          \"alt\": null,\n          \"title\": \"IMG_3985\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`It is now 2 in the morning here in Paris, and I am on par with how the rest of these blog entries have been written.
