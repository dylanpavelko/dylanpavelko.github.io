Frankly, I think the citizens of San Luis Obispo should be able to have a say in that decision. If we are content with the current pay rates for firefighters and policeman, because we think it attracts better candidates, we should be able to make that decision. Having an election for such a decision seems worthwhile, and likely could be scheduled in to a pre-scheduled election (unlike this unscheduled special election which technically won\\u2019t change anything about SLO just how we can make changes). For these reasons I am voting NO on Measure A.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Measure B also seems like a situation where the city council members are attempting to give themselves more power. Essentially the current situation is if two sides can\\u2019t agree after negotiations, they talk to a middle man who considers both points of views and comes up with a fair solution. Measure B is trying to take out that middle man and force the agreement to be the best offer of the governing body (the city council). Immediately this seems counter intuitive to me, the city council members attempt to reason their decision making by stating arbitrators are not member of our community, and won\\u2019t understand us. However I feel like having an outsider when the two inside parties can not agree is likely the best solution.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The main point I found in the rebuttal against the argument to Measures A and B, is that they believe city workers are being paid too much compared to inflation, and other measurements (including average citizens financial situations).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In short, I don\\u2019t think any of this would be a concern if the city was balancing its budget, and I don\\u2019t think we should be looking at civil servants salaries and pensions as the place to save money.
