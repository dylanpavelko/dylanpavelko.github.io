Dishes are served all at once, warm or room temperature (except the rice which is served steaming hot) and shared by everyone at the table (also except the rice, and soup, which each person gets an individual plate of rice), instead of individual courses hot as customary in western dining. The idea is that the food blends together as you eat the various dishes.

Thai dishes are all about balance. 

Four elements according to serious eats
-wet: anything saucy or brothy and served in a bowl. soup, curry. ensures the meal (and especially the rice) never gets too dry. Try to balance mulitple wet dishes between rich and light.
-dry: stir-fries, grilled meats, steamed fish, deep-fried finger foods. most meals have multiple dry dishes. Balance dry dishes perhaps by being meat vs. vegetable centric.
-fresh: acts like a palate cleanser and is often refreshing and light with lots of lime, aromatic herbs, and fresh vegetables. Often this is a salad
-spicy: spice adds a sensational dimension to your meal that keeps your taste buds engaged. Not having anything spicy in the meal is missing a key flavor but you also don't want all of your dishes to be spicy.

Dishes can serve multiple purposes. (Ex: wet and spicy)

Balance between proteins.

Balance between tastes.
-sweet
-sour
-salty
-bitter or creamy (seen both listed)
-hot

Rice is the anchor, and meant to be eaten with everything. 

Note noodle dishes are not traditional and are more of a standalone dish which makes them popular as street food.
