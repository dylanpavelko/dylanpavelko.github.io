		      <p>The start of the legal battle for marriage equality began at University of Minnesota's Minneapolis campus when James Michael MicConnel, a librarian, and Richard John Baker, a law student, applied for a marriage license and were denied by the Clerk of Disctrict Court Gerald Nelson on the basis that they were both men. Baker sued Nelson insisting that the license was not fordbidden (using the legal maxim 'everything that is not forbidden is permitted'). <br><br>

		      The case was heard by the Minnesota Supreme Court (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Nelson"><em>Baker v. Nelson</em></a>) who ruled agains the couple stating that "construcing a marriage statute to restrict marriage to persons of the opposite sex "does not offend" the U.S. Constitution. Baker appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that if the court were to construe statues to require opposite-sex couples it would violate their fundamental right to marry under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, discrimination based on gender, contrary to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and deprived them of privacy rights flowing from the Ninth Ammendment.<br><br>
		  	  The US. Supreme Court dismissed hearing the case with the single sentence stating "The appeal is dismissed for want of substantial federal question." <span class="yellow">The U.S. Supreme Courts' dismissal of hearing the case was considered to be a decision on the merits of the case and became binding precedent resulting in lower courts from coming to a contrary conclusion when presented with the precise issue the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear.</span> This effectively prevented any legal challenges to same-sex marriage for the next twenty years.</p>

		      <h2>May 17, 2004</h2>
		      <p>Massachussetts becomes the first state to legalize same-sex marriage via a court ruling that the state's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. The court said: "We declare that barring an individual from the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage solely because that person would marry a person of the same sex violates the Massachusetts Constitution." It provided a definition of marriage that would meet the State Constitution's requirements: "We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others." The court stayed its ruling for 180 days (i.e. until May 17, 2004) to allow the General Court to "take such action as it may deem appropriate in light of this opinion."[1]<br><br>
		      	On February 4, 2004, the court replied that it was unacceptable to allow different-sex couples marriages but same-sex couples only civil unions, that the distinction between marriage and civil unions constituted unconstitutional discrimination, even if the rights and obligations attached to each were identical. It called the difference between the terms marriage and civil union "a considered choice of language that reflects a demonstrable assigning of same-sex, largely homosexual, couples to second-class status."
		  		The state law went in to affect May 17, 2004.
		  	<br><br>
		  	In response on November 2, 2004 eleven states passed state constituonal amendments defining marriage between a man and a woman. By 2006 the number had grown to 21 states, and by 2009 29 states had constituional provisions restricting marriage and an additional 12 had statues that did so.</p>

		      <p>The resulitng series of court cases emerging, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollingsworth_v._Perry"><em>Hollingsworth v. Perry</em></a>, from the passage of Prop 8 in California was heard by Judge Vaughn Walker who in 2010 <span class="yellow">ruled that the banning of same-sex marriage violated equal protection under the law granted by the Fourteenth Amendment.</span> After the State of California refused to continue to defend Proposiion 8 the official sponosors of the propsoition intervened and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a somewhat confusing ruling in 2013 the Supreme Court ruled that the official sponsors did not have proper standing to appeal an adverse federal court ruling when the state refused to do so. As a result Judge Walker's findings remain the controlling precedent and Proposition 8 invalid. This meant that <span class="yellow">same-sex marriage was again legal in California based on the repeal of Prop 8 but had no legal consequence for other states or federal marriage recognition</span> and was not considered an opinion by the U.S. Supreme Court on same-sex marriage itself.<br><br>
		      On the same day, the U.S. Supreme Court also issued a ruling on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor"><em>United States v. Windsor</em></a>. Edith Windsor had been legally married in New York to her wife Thea Spyer. Spyer died in 2009 leaving her estate to Windsor who was barred from claiming the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses based on the Defense of Marriage Act. After hearing the case <span class="yellow">the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act violated the constitution as it was a "deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment".</span> In a dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia argued the Court had "no power under the Constitution to invalidate a democratically adopted legislation". This ruling enabled same-sex marriages to be recognized federally with all the associated benefits. <br><br>
		      Following this ruling the Obama Adminstration ordered the following benefits for all same-sex marriages, regardless if the couple resided in a state that recognized their union or not:
